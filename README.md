Security Knowledge Framework is an expert system application that uses the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard with detailed code examples (secure coding principles) to help developers in pre-development and post-development phases and create applications that are secure by design.

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Our experience taught us that the current level of security of web-applications is not sufficient enough to ensure security. This is mainly because web-developers simply aren't aware of the risks and dangers that are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers.

Because of this we decided to develop a framework in order to create a guide-system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design from the start.

The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework is here to support developers in creating secure applications. By using the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standards.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project) as a security requirement and give the developer feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these security controls in a safe manner.

The second stage is validating if the developer properly implemented different security controls and the belonging defence mechanisms by means of checklists created with the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standards.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project) By means of the answers supplied by the developer the application again generates documentation in which it gives feedback on what defence mechanisms the developer forgot to implement and gives him feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these techniques in a safe manner.

export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
flask updatedb
```

## <a name="updating-dataset"></a>Updating chatbot

There is a method available to update the dataset of the SKF chatbot application.
