The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework is an open source web application that explains secure coding principles in multiple programming languages. The goal of OWASP-SKF is to help you learn and integrate security by design in your software development and build applications that are secure by design. OWASP-SKF does this through manageable software development projects with checklists (using OWASP-ASVS/OWASP-MASVS  or custom security checklists) and labs to practice security verification (using SKF-Labs, OWASP Juice-shop, and best practice code examples from SKF and the OWASP-Cheatsheets).

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Our experience taught us that the current level of security of web-applications is not sufficient enough to ensure security. This is mainly because web-developers simply aren't aware of the risks and dangers that are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers.

Because of this we decided to develop a framework in order to create a guide-system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design from the start.

## <a name="updating-db"></a>Updating Database

There is a method available to update the content of the SKF application.

When you have modified or created new Knowledge base items, code examples or checklist you need to run the following commands in the SKF root directory:
```
export FLASK_APP=skf/app.py
export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
flask updatedb
```

## <a name="updating-dataset"></a>Updating chatbot

There is a method available to update the dataset of the SKF chatbot application.

When you have modified or created new Knowledge base items, code examples or checklist you need to run the following commands in the SKF root directory:
```
export FLASK_APP=skf/app.py
export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
flask initdataset
```
