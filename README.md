## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Our experience taught us that the current level of security the current web-applications contain is not sufficient enough to ensure security. This is mainly because web-developers simply aren't aware of the risks and dangers which are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers.

Because of this we decided to develop a proof of concept framework in order to create a guide system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design.

The security knowledge framework is here to support developers create secure applications. By analysing processing techniques in which the developers use to edit their data the application can link these techniques to different known vulnerabilities and give the developer feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these techniques in a safe manner.

The second stage of the application is validating if the developer properly implemented different types of defence mechanisms by means of checklists with among others the OWASP Application security verification standards.

By means of the answers supplied by the developer the application again generates documentation in which it gives feedback on what defence mechanisms the developer forgot to implement and give him feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these techniques in a safe manner.

## <a name="installing"></a>Installing

### Docker

When Docker is available, the fastest way to start using the SKF project is using the pre-built container hosted at Docker hub.
```
docker run -ti -p 127.0.0.1:443:5443 blabla1337/skf-flask
```

The application will greet you on:
https://127.0.0.1

This container always has the very latest version from the repository.

### Automated installation with Chef

The easiest way to use the SKF project is using the Chef cookbook that we created.

What is Chef?

*Chef is a configuration management and automation platform from Opscode. Chef helps you describe your infrastructure with code. Because your infrastructure is managed with code, it can be automated, tested and reproduced with ease. Check out [https://www.chef.io](https://www.chef.io) for more information about Chef*  

For using the SKF chef cookbook you will need to install the 3 software products on your machine/laptop. Those are all free to use.

**VirtualBox**
* VirtualBox is a free to use Virtual Machine that can load images.
* [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads ](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads )

**Chef Development Kit**
* Chef Development Kit is a free to use tooling for testing and running cookbooks created with chef.
* [https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)

**Vagrant**
* Vagrant has pre-build images ready to use for stable and fast development.
* [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

When you have installed the above software you are now able to create a VirtualBox image with Vagrant configuration and using Chef to configure the SKF application. The SKF chef cookbook will do this all for you and you only need to follow the steps below on your machine/laptop.

```bash
cd ~/
wget https://github.com/blabla1337/owasp-skf-chef/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd owasp-skf-chef-master
kitchen converge default
```

Now you have to wait a few minutes and watch the magic happen! ^^
When the Chef run has completed (-----> Kitchen is finished!) the application is ready to use. When you will start the VirtualBox GUI you can see the cookbook created a new VB image that is running and holding the SKF application.

The application will greet you on
https://192.168.33.118

Below are some useful Kitchen 101 commands, all of which should be run in the SKF chef directory
```bash
# Command for creating the VM with the SKF project
kitchen converge default

# Command for login to the VM with the SKF project
kitchen login default

# Command for detroying the VM with the SKF project
kitchen destroy
```

### AWS installation

A CloudFormation template is provided to make it easy to set up the
Security Knowledge Framework in AWS. For more information consult
[the README in the `cloudformation` directory](cloudformation/README.md).

### Ubuntu manual installation

To run SKF you need Python pip and sqlite3 database support.
```bash
# On 64-bit platform
sudo apt-get install python-pip sqlite3 lib32z1-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev

# On 32-bit platform
sudo apt-get install python-pip sqlite3 zlib1g-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
```

After the prerequisites you can install the Python packages.
```bash
sudo pip install https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tarball/master
sudo pip install owasp-skf
```

Now you can start the program by opening the folder (e.g. /opt/owasp-skf/) and run:
```bash
python skf.py
```

### Windows manual installation

Download and install [Python 2.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/)

Run below commands in cmd (As Administrator):
```
C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tarball/master
C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install owasp-skf
```

Now you can start the program by opening the folder and run the skf.py file:
```
cd C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\skf
C:\Python27\python.exe skf.py
```
### Mac OSX manual installation

The first step is to install brew
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

After installing brew you can now install sqllite3
```bash
brew install python-pip sqlite3
```

Now we install python pip
```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```

After the prerequisites you can install the Python packages.
```bash
sudo pip install https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tarball/master
sudo pip install owasp-skf
```

Now you can start the program by opening the folder (e.g. /opt/owasp-skf/) and run:
```bash
sudo python skf.py
```

### Ubuntu Apache WSGI Setup (manual installation)

To run the OWASP-SKF as a service (SaaS) you can hook it up to your existing webservers using the WSGI module.

First do the normal owasp-skf installation.
User that is installing this software is foobar, change foobar for your own user
```bash
apt-get install git apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi
sudo a2enmod wsgi
cd /home/foobar
git clone https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-flask.git
```

Now disable SSL settings, we want Apache to do this

Edit the file file:
/home/foobar/skf-flask/skf/skf.py
```bash
  Change line:
       app.run(host=bindaddr, port=5443, ssl_context='adhoc')
  to:
       app.run(host=bindaddr, port=5443)
```

Now we can edit the configuration file of Apache

Edit the following file and add this below the virtualHost config for port 80
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```bash
  WSGIRestrictStdout Off
  Listen 5443
  <VirtualHost *:5443>

    WSGIDaemonProcess skf user=www-data group=www-data threads=5
    WSGIScriptAlias / /home/foobar/skf-flask/skf/skf.wsgi

    <Directory /home/foobar/skf-flask/skf>
        WSGIProcessGroup skf
        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

  </VirtualHost>
```

Now edit the configuration file of WSGI

Edit the following file:
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/wsgi.conf
Add below inside the if_module of mod_wsgi:
```bash
  <FilesMatch ".+\.py$">
    SetHandler wsgi-script
  </FilesMatch>

  # Deny access to compiled binaries
  # You should not serve these to anyone
  <FilesMatch ".+\.py(c|o)$">
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
  </FilesMatch>
```
Create the WSGI file so it can be loaded by Apache

Create new skf.py file:
/home/foobar/skf-flask/skf/skf.wsgi
```bash
import sys, os
sys.path.insert (0,'/home/foobar/skf-flask/skf')
os.chdir("/home/foobar/skf-flask/skf")
from skf import app as application
```

The final step:
```bash
chmod +x /home/foobar/skf-flask/skf/skf.py
chown -R www-data:www-data /home/foobar/skf-flask
sudo service apache2 restart
```

The application can be visited at port http://the_ip_/:5443
Also now you can apply your favourite Apache SSL/TLS settings.
