Security Knowledge Framework is an expert system application that uses the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard with detailed code examples (secure coding principles) to help developers in pre-development and post-development phases and create applications that are secure by design.

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Our experience taught us that the current level of security of web-applications is not sufficient enough to ensure security. This is mainly because web-developers simply aren't aware of the risks and dangers that are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers.

Because of this we decided to develop a framework in order to create a guide-system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design from the start.

The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework is here to support developers create secure applications. By using the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standards.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project) as a security requirement and give the developer feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these security controls in a safe manner.

The second stage is validating if the developer properly implemented different security controls and the belonging defence mechanisms by means of checklists created with the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standards.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project) By means of the answers supplied by the developer the application again generates documentation in which it gives feedback on what defence mechanisms the developer forgot to implement and give him feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these techniques in a safe manner.

## <a name="installing"></a>Installing

### Local install
Local installation based on Ubuntu 16.04.

#### Requirements:
- nginx (```sudo apt install nginx```)
- npm (```sudo apt install npm```)
- ng (```sudo apt install ng-common```)
- latest version of node ():
```
    * sudo npm install n -g
    * sudo n stable
```
- python3.6, pip3.6 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42662104/how-to-install-pip-for-python-3-6-on-ubuntu-16-10):
```
    * sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6  # (only for 16.04 LTS)
    * sudo apt update
    * sudo apt install python3.6
    * wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    * sudo python3.6 get-pip.py
```

#### Installation:
Run on terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/blabla1337/skf-flask.git
cd skf-flask/Angular
npm install
cd ..
sudo pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt
```

Modify the files in Local folder
- site.conf: set both root directories acording to your installation.
- site-tls.conf: set both root directories acording to your installation and ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key locations.
- entrypoint.sh: change JWT_SECRET and if changed from default, nginx installation folder. Also if you want to run on a specif domain and not on localhost change ORIGIN.


#### Run SKF (with terminal in Local folder):
```
./entrypoint.sh
```
Navigate to https://localhost

#### Error:
If you get the following error
```
nginx: [emerg] a duplicate default server for 0.0.0.0:80 in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default:17
```
If you are not using that file just remove it: (```sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default```)

### Docker

The fastest way to start using the SKF project is using the pre-built container hosted at Docker hub. This container always has the very latest version from the master repository. Change the JWT_SECRET value to a new random secret string before starting the docker image.

First run the docker pull command to get the latest image
```
docker pull blabla1337/skf-flask
```
Then start the docker image 
```
docker run -e "ORIGIN=localhost" -e "JWT_SECRET=change_this_super_secret_random_string" -ti -p 127.0.0.1:443:443 blabla1337/skf-flask
```

The application will greet you on:
https://localhost

## <a name="updating"></a>Updating

There is a method available to update the content of the SKF application.

When you have modified or created new Knowledge base items, code examples or checklist you need to run the following commands in the SKF root directory:
```
export FLASK_APP=skf/app.py
export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
flask updatedb
```
