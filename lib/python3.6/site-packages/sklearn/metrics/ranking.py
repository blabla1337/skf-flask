    This is a general function, given points on a curve.  For computing the
    area under the ROC-curve, see :func:`roc_auc_score`.  For an alternative
    way to summarize a precision-recall curve, see
    :func:`average_precision_score`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array, shape = [n]
        x coordinates. These must be either monotonic increasing or monotonic
        decreasing.
    y : array, shape = [n]
        y coordinates.
    reorder : boolean, optional (default='deprecated')
        Whether to sort x before computing. If False, assume that x must be
        either monotonic increasing or monotonic decreasing. If True, y is
        used to break ties when sorting x. Make sure that y has a monotonic
        relation to x when setting reorder to True.

        .. deprecated:: 0.20
           Parameter ``reorder`` has been deprecated in version 0.20 and will
           be removed in 0.22. It's introduced for roc_auc_score (not for
           general use) and is no longer used there. What's more, the result
           from auc will be significantly influenced if x is sorted
           unexpectedly due to slight floating point error (See issue #9786).
           Future (and default) behavior is equivalent to ``reorder=False``.

            indicator matrix as a label.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average.

        Will be ignored when ``y_true`` is binary.

    pos_label : int or str (default=1)
        The label of the positive class. Only applied to binary ``y_true``.
        For multilabel-indicator ``y_true``, ``pos_label`` is fixed to 1.

    """Compute Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <roc_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).

    pos_label : int or str, default=None
        Label considered as positive and others are considered negative.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    drop_intermediate : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether to drop some suboptimal thresholds which would not appear
        on a plotted ROC curve. This is useful in order to create lighter
        ROC curves.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           parameter *drop_intermediate*.

    Returns
    -------
    fpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    tpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing true positive rates such that element i is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `max(y_score) + 1`.

    See also
    --------
    roc_auc_score : Compute the area under the ROC curve

    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.
