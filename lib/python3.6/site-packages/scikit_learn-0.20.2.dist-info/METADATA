scikit-learn
============

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the `About us <http://scikit-learn.org/dev/about.html#authors>`_ page
for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Website: http://scikit-learn.org


Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.4)
- NumPy (>= 1.8.2)
- SciPy (>= 0.13.3)

**Scikit-learn 0.20 is the last version to support Python2.7.**
Scikit-learn 0.21 and later will require Python 3.5 or newer.

For running the examples Matplotlib >= 1.4 is required. A few examples
require scikit-image >= 0.11.3, a few examples require pandas >= 0.17.1
and a few example require joblib >= 0.11.

scikit-learn also uses CBLAS, the C interface to the Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms library. scikit-learn comes with a reference implementation, but
the system CBLAS will be detected by the build system and used if present.
CBLAS exists in many implementations; see `Linear algebra libraries
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computing#linear-algebra-libraries>`_
for known issues.

User installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.


Changelog
---------

See the `changelog <http://scikit-learn.org/dev/whats_new.html>`__
for a history of notable changes to scikit-learn.

Development
-----------

We welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn
community goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective. The
`Development Guide <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html>`_
has detailed information about contributing code, documentation, tests, and
more. We've included some basic information in this README.

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can check the latest sources with the command::

    git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git

Setting up a development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick tutorial on how to go about setting up your environment to
contribute to scikit-learn: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Testing
~~~~~~~

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the
source directory (you will need to have ``pytest`` >= 3.3.0 installed)::

    pytest sklearn

See the web page http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/advanced_installation.html#testing
for more information.

    Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting
    the ``SKLEARN_SEED`` environment variable.
