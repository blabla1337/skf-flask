This library provides an `httplib2`_ transport for `google-auth`_.

.. note:: ``httplib`` has lots of problems such as lack of threadsafety
    and insecure usage of TLS. Using it is highly discouraged. This
    library is intended to help existing users of ``oauth2client`` migrate to
    ``google-auth``.
