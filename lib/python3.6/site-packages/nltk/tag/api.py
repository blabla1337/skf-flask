    A processing interface for assigning a tag to each token in a list.
    Tags are case sensitive strings that identify some property of each
    token, such as its part of speech or its sense.

    Some taggers require specific types for their tokens.  This is
    generally indicated by the use of a sub-interface to ``TaggerI``.
    For example, featureset taggers, which are subclassed from
    ``FeaturesetTagger``, require that each token be a ``featureset``.

    Subclasses must define:
      - either ``tag()`` or ``tag_sents()`` (or both)
