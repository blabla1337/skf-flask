Directory listing
-------

**Description:**
Whenever directory listing is enabled an attacker could gain sensitive information about the systems hierarchical structure and gain knowledge about directorys which should possibly not be publicly accesible. An attacker could use this information to increase his attack vector.


**Solution:**
Different types of servers require a different type of aproach in order to disable directory listing. 
for instance: apache uses a .htacces in order to disble directory listing. 
As in iis7 direcory listing is disabled by default.
