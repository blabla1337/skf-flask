"title": "Filename injection Path traversal",
"Description": "A Path Traversal attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By browsing the application, the attacker looks for absolute links to files stored on the web server. By manipulating variables that reference files with dotdotslash (../); sequences and its variations, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and critical system files, limited by system operational access control. The attacker uses  ../../ sequences to move up to root directory, thus permitting navigation through the file system. This attack can be executed with an external malicious code injected on the path, like the Resource Injection attack.  ",
"Solution": "The most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing usersubmitted input to any filesystem/framework API. If this is not possible the application can maintain a white list of files, that may be included on the page, and then use an identifier (for example the index number) to access the selected file. Any request containing an invalid identifier has to be rejected, in this way there is no attack surface for malicious users to manipulate the path."

"title": "XSS injection",
"Description": "Every time the application gets userinput, whether this showing it on screen or processing this data in the application background, these parameters should be escaped for malicious code in order to prevent crosssite scripting injections. When an attacker gains the possibility to perform an XSS injection, he is given the opportunity to inject HTML and JavaScript code directly into the application. This could lead to accounts being compromised by stealing session cookies or directly  affect the operation of the target application. Altough templating engines(razor, twig, jinja, etc) and contextaware applications(Angular, React, etc) do a lot of auto escaping for you. These frameworks should always be validated for effectiveness.  ",
"Solution": "In order to prevent XSS injections, all userinput should be escaped or encoded. You could start by sanitizing userinput as soon as it is inserted into the application, by preference using a so called whitelisting method. This means you should not check for malicious content like the tags or anything, but only allow the expected input. Every input which is outside of the intended operation of the application should immediately be detected and login rejected. Do not try to help use the input in any way because that could introduce a new type of attack by converting characters. The second step would be encoding all the parameters or userinput before putting this in your html with encoding libraries specially designed for this purpose.You should take into consideration that there are several contexts for encoding userinput for escaping XSS injections. These contexts are amongst others:* HTML encoding, is for whenever your userinput is displayed directly into your HTML. * HTML attribute encoding, is the type of encoding/escaping that should be applied    whenever your user input is displayed into the attribute of your HTML tags. * HTML URL encoding, this type of encoding/escaping should be applied to whenever you are using userinput into a HREF tag.JavaScript encoding should be used whenever parameters are rendered via JavaScript; your application will detect normal injections in the first instant. But your application still remains vulnerable to JavaScript encoding which will not be detected by the normal encoding/escaping methods."

"title": "Command injection",
"Description": "Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attackersupplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation. This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code injection allows the attacker to adds his own code that is then executed by the application. In Code Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application without the necessity of executing system commands. ",
"Solution": "Userinput that is used in a shell command should not contain dangerous characters. A blacklist of characters is not a good option because it may be difficult to think of all of the characters to validate against. A white list containing only allowable characters should be created to validate the userinput. "

"Description": "CrossSite Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious Web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a users Web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.The impact of a successful crosssite request forgery attack is limited to the capabilities exposed by the vulnerable application. For example, this attack could result in a transfer of funds, changing a password, or purchasing an item in the users context. In effect, CSRF attacks are used by an attacker to make a target system perform a function (funds Transfer, form submission etc.) via the targets browser without knowledge of the target user at least until the unauthorised function has been committed. ",
"Solution": "To arm an application against automated attacks and tooling you need to use unique tokens which are included into the forms of an application, API calls or AJAX requests.   Any state changing operation requires a secure random token (e.g CSRF token) to prevent against CSRF attacks. Characteristics of a CSRF Token are a unique, large random value generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator.The CSRF token is then added as a hidden field for forms and validated on the sever side whenever a user is sending a request to the server.Note : Whenever the application is an REST service and is using tokens such as JWT tokens, whenever these tokens are being sent in the application headers rather than stored in cookies the application should not be suspectible to CSRF attacks for a succesfull CSRF attacke depends on the browsers cookie jar.

"Description": "Processing of an external entity containing tainted data may lead to the disclosure of confidential information and other system impacts. The XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There exists a specific type of entity, an external general parsed entity often shortened to an external entity that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the entity. The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application. Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier. Since the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via HTTP(s) requests. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to clientside memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability if too many threads or processes are not released.  ",

This could result in the execution of arbitrary commands such as granting permissions to unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree. The same advanced exploitation techniques available in SQL Injection can be similarly applied in LDAP Injection. ",
"Solution": "The best way to prevent LDAP injection is to use a positive validation scheme for ensuring that the data going into your queries does not contain any attacks. However, in some cases, it is necessary to include special characters in the input that is passed into an LDAP query. In this case, using escaping can prevent the LDAP interpreter from thinking those special characters are actually part of the LDAP query. "

"Description": "Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to backend systems, and simple defacement.There are really two classes of problems here. The first is with the file metadata, like the path and file name. These are generally provided by the transport, such as HTTP multipart encoding. This data may trick the application into overwriting a critical file or storing the file in a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely carefully before using it.The other class of problem is with the file size or content. An attacker can easily craft a valid image file with PHP code inside. ",
"Solution": " Uploaded files always need to be placed outside the document root of the webserver  Check to not accept large files that could fill up storage or cause a denial of service attack  Check the userinput(filename) for having the right allowed extensions such as .jpg, .png etc   Note: when checking these extensions always make sure your application validates the last   possible extension so an attacker could not simply inject \".jpg.php\" and bypass your   validation Check the userinput(filename) for containing possible path traversal patterns in order to prevent him from uploading outside of the intended directory.You may also want to check if the filenames do already exist before uploading in order to prevent the overwriting of files.Also for serving the files back there needs to be a file handler function that can select the file based on an identifier that will serve the file back towards the user.Most developers also do a mimetype check. This is a good protection however not whenever you are checking this mimetype through the post request. This header can not be trusted since it can be easily manipulated by an attacker.The best way to check the mimetype is to extract the file from the server after uploading and check it from the file itself.

"Solution": "One option is not to use components that you did not write. But that is not very realistic.Most component projects do not create vulnerability patches for old versions. Instead, most simply fix the problem in the next version. So upgrading to these new versions is critical. Software projects should have a process in place to:Identify all components and the versions you are using, including all dependencies. (e.g., the versions plugin).Monitor the security of these components in public databases, project mailing lists, and security mailing lists, and keep them up to date.Establish security policies governing components use, such as requiring certain software development practices, passing security tests, and acceptable licenses.Where appropriate, consider adding security wrappers around components to disable unused functionality and/ or secure weak or vulnerable aspects of the component.This also goes for all other components that should be up to date with proper security configuration(s) and version(s) such as server OS etc.This should include removal of unneeded configurations and folders such as sample applications, platform documentation, and default or example users.

Because this process is difficult to reverse (similar to a cryptographic hash function) but can also be configured to be slow to compute, key derivation functions are ideally  suited for password hashing use cases.Another alternative would be bcrypt. bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by  Niels Provos and David Mazi\u00e8res, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in  1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an  adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower,  so it remains resistant to bruteforce search attacks even with increasing computation power.

You should enforce a lockout whenever a unreasonable number of violations are detected by your application in order to protect it from attackers. "

"title": "CA certificates",
"Description": "In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. Sometimes it happens that a CA goes bad and is revoked from the browser. This will lead to untrusted TLS connections if your application uses an issued certificate from this CA.A selfsigned certificate is an identity certificate that is signed by the same entity whose identity it certifies. This term has nothing to do with the identity of the person or organization that actually performed the signing procedure. In technical terms a selfsigned certificate is one signed with its own private key.In typical public key infrastructure (PKI) arrangements, a digital signature from a certificate authority (CA) attests that a particular public key certificate is valid. Each CA has one or more root keys; and the certificates associated with those public keys are \"trust anchors\" that use a special type of selfsigned certificates. Establishing trust of the CA root certificate is dependent upon procedures beyond checking its digital signature. ",
"Solution": "In a CA based PKI system, the CA must be trusted by both parties. This is usually accomplished by placing the CA certificates in a whitelist of trusted certificates. For example, web browsers developers may use procedures specified by the CA/Browser Forum, or a private CA''s certificate may be placed in the firmware of an embedded system. The trust issues of an entity accepting a new selfsigned certificate, is similar to the issues of an entity trusting the addition of a new CA certificate. The parties in a selfsigned PKI must establish trust with each other (using procedures outside the PKI), and confirm the accurate transfer of public keys (e.g. compare the hash out of band).There are many subtle differences between CA signed and selfsigned certificates, especially in the amount of trust that can be placed in the security assertions of the certificate. Some CAs can verify the identity of the person to whom they issue a certificate; for example the US military issues their Common Access Cards in person, with multiple forms of other ID. The CA can attest identity values like these by including them in the signed certificate. The entity that validates the certificate can trust the information in that certificate, to the same extent that they trust the CA that signed it (and by implication, the security procedures the CA used to verify the attested information).With a selfsigned certificate by contrast, trust of the values in the certificate are more complicated because the entity possesses the signing key, and can always generate a new certificate with different values. For example, the validity dates of a selfsigned certificate might not be trusted because the entity could always create and sign a new certificate that contained a valid date range. The values in a selfsigned certificate can be trusted when the following conditions are true: the values were (outofband) verified when the selfsigned was formally trusted, and there is a method to verify the selfsigned certificate has not changed after it was trusted. For example, the procedure of trusting a selfsigned certificate includes a manual verification of validity dates, and a hash of the certificate is incorporated into the white list. When the certificate is presented for an entity to validate, they first verify the hash of the certificate matches the reference hash in the whitelist, and if they match (indicating the selfsigned certificate is the same as the one that was formally trusted) then the certificate''s validity dates can be trusted. Special treatment of X.509 certificate fields for selfsigned certificate can be found in RFC 3280.Verify that connections to and from the server use trusted TLS certificates. Where internally generated or selfsigned certificates are used, the server must be configured to only trust specific internal CAs and specific selfsigned certificates. All others should be rejected.

It is often used to execute untested code, or untrusted programs from unverified third parties, suppliers, untrusted users and untrusted websites. It''s creating an extra layer of security where an attacker first needs to break out from. ",
"Solution": "Examples of sandbox implementations include the following: A jail: networkaccess restrictions, and a restricted file system namespace. Jails are most commonly used in virtual hosting. Rulebased execution gives users full control over what processes are started, spawned (by other applications), or allowed to inject code into other applications and have access to the net, by having the system assign access levels to users or programs according to a set of determined rules. It also can control file/registry security (what programs can read and write to the file system/registry). In such an environment, viruses and Trojans have fewer opportunities of infecting a computer. The SELinux and AppArmor security frameworks are two such implementations for Linux. Virtual machines emulate a complete host computer, on which a conventional operating system may boot and run as on actual hardware. The guest operating system runs sandboxed in the sense that it does not function natively on the host and can only access host resources through the emulator. Sandboxing on native hosts: Security researchers rely heavily on sandboxing technologies to analyze malware behavior  By creating an environment that mimics or replicates the targeted desktops, researchers can evaluate how malware infects and compromises a target host. Numerous malware analysis services are based on the sandboxing technology. Capability systems can be thought of as a finegrained sandboxing mechanism, in which programs are given opaque tokens when spawned and have the ability to do specific things based on what tokens they hold. Capabilitybased implementations can work at various levels, from kernel to userspace. An example of capabilitybased userlevel sandboxing involves HTML rendering in a Web browser. Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a sandbox built in the Linux kernel. When activated, seccomp only allows the write(), read(), exit(), and sigreturn() system calls. HTML5 has a \"sandbox\" attribute for use with iframes. Java virtual machines include a sandbox to restrict the actions of untrusted code, such as a Java applet. The .NET Common Language Runtime provides Code Access Security to enforce restrictions on a untrusted code.``` "

In the past, the XMLHttpRequest L1 API only allowed requests to be sent within the same origin as it was restricted by the same origin policy. ",
"Solution": "CrossOrigin requests have an Origin header, that identifies the domain initiating the request and is always sent to the server. CORS defines the protocol to use a web browser and a server to determine whether a crossorigin request is allowed. In order to accomplish this goal, there are a few HTTP headers involved in this process, that are supported by all major browsers: Origin  AccessControlRequestMethod  AccessControlRequestHeaders  AccessControlAllowOrigin  AccessControlAllowCredentials  AccessControlAllowMethods  AccessControlAllowHeadersThings you must consider when using CORS1. Validate URLs passed to XMLHttpRequest.open. Current browsers allow these URLs to be cross domain; this behavior can lead to code injection by a remote attacker. Pay extra attention to absolute URLs.2. Ensure that URLs responding with AccessControlAllowOrigin: * do not include any sensitive content or information that might aid an attacker in further attacks. Use the AccessControlAllowOrigin header only on chosen URLs that need to be accessed crossdomain. Don''t use the header for the whole domain.3. Allow only selected, trusted domains in the AccessControlAllowOrigin header. Prefer whitelisting domains over blacklisting or allowing any domain (do not use * wildcard nor blindly return the Origin header content without any checks)4. Keep in mind that CORS does not prevent the requested data from going to an unauthenticated location. It''s still important for the server to perform usual CSRF prevention.5. While the RFC recommends a preflight request with the OPTIONS verb, current implementations might not perform this request, so it''s important that \"ordinary\" (GET and POST) requests perform any access control necessary.6. Discard requests received over plain HTTP with HTTPS origins to prevent mixed content bugs.7. Don''t rely only on the Origin header for Access Control checks. Browser always sends this header in CORS requests, but may be spoofed outside the browser. Applicationlevel protocols should be used to protect sensitive data.**NOTE:**  Modern application frameworks do dynamically allocation of the origin header, resulting in the browser also allowing to send the \"AccessControlAllowCredentials: true\" header as well in requests.  Whenever JSON web tokens are being send in cookies rather than headers, potential attackers could abuse this behaviour to  make unauthenticated XHR get requests on the authenticated users behalf to read sensitive information from the  pages.

Prefilling by the application implies that credentials are stored in plaintext or a reversible format, which is explicitly prohibited. Passwords should be stored by preferably PBKDF functions.PBKDF2 uses a pseudorandom function and a configurable number of iterations to derive a cryptographic key from a password. Because this process is difficult to reverse (similar to a cryptographic hash function) but can also be configured to be slow to  compute, key derivation functions are ideally suited for password hashing use cases.Examples of good ways to store passwords are with, BCRYPT, Blowfish or in some cases SCRYPT which is a little harder to implement correctlyNOTE: Password prefilling also happens when using the browsers password manager.

"Solution": "The recommended solutions are to use TOTP (Timebased OneTime Password algorithm). This  method is an example of a hashbased message authentication code (HMAC). It combines a  secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate  a onetime password. Because network latency and outofsync clocks can result in the password  recipient having to try a range of possible times to authenticate against, the timestamp typically  increases in 30second intervals, which thus cuts the potential search space.Or the other option is to use a Mathematicalalgorithmbased onetime password method. This other  type of onetime password uses a complex mathematical algorithm, such as a hash chain, to generate  a series of onetime passwords from a secret shared key. Each password cannot be guessed even when  previous passwords are known. The open source OAuth algorithm is standardized; other algorithms are  covered by U.S. patents. Each password is observably unpredictable and independent on previous ones.  Therefore, an adversary would be unable to guess what the next password may be, even with the  knowledge of all previous passwords.Example of a hard token mathimatical algorithm would be a yubikey Example of a soft token TOTP would be google authenticatorThe last resort would be to send a new password by email. This mail should contain a reset link with  a token which is valid for a limited amount of time. Additional authentication based on softtokens  (e.g. SMS token, native mobile applications, etc.) can be required as well before the link is  sent over.

Instead of solely depending on role based authentication methods using sessions, we rather want to assign privileges to users by means of a DatabaseBased Authentication system.We still use sessions in order to identify if the user was logged in correctly, only now instead of assigning that user with a specific role we assign him with privileges to verify which actions he is privileged to perform on the system.Also, a big pro of this method is, whenever a user has to be assigned fewer privileges your changes will be applied on the fly since the assigning does not depend on the session which otherwise had to expire first.

"Description": "HTTP offers a number of methods that can be used to perform actions on the web server. Many of these methods are designed to aid developers in deploying and testing HTTP applications. These HTTP methods can be used for nefarious purposes if the web server is misconfigured. It recommended to read about the different available methods, their purposes and limitations.Available method are:GET The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)[1] The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, \"Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.HEAD The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving metainformation written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.POST The POST method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a datahandling process; or an item to add to a database. PUT The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI. DELETE The DELETE method deletes the specified resource. TRACE The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.OPTIONS The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting ''*'' instead of a specific resource.CONNECT The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSLencrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.PATCH The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.Some of the methods (for example, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE) are, by convention, defined as safe, which means they are intended only for information retrieval and should not change the state of the server. In other words, they should not have side effects, beyond relatively harmless effects such as logging, web caching, the serving of banner advertisements or incrementing a web counter. Making arbitrary GET requests without regard to the context of the application''s state should therefore be considered safe. However, this is not mandated by the standard, and it is explicitly acknowledged that it cannot be guaranteed.Despite the prescribed safety of GET requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Therefore, careless or deliberate programming can cause nontrivial changes on the server. This is discouraged, because it can cause problems for web caching, search engines and other automated agents, which can make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as http://example.com/article/1234/delete, which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using GET, would simply delete the article.By contrast, methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH are intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as financial transactions or transmission of email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.Methods PUT and DELETE are defined to be idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request (note that idempotence refers to the state of the system after the request has completed, so while the action the server takes (e.g. deleting a record) or the response code it returns may be different on subsequent requests, the system state will be the same every time). Methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, being prescribed as safe, should also be idempotent, as HTTP is a stateless protocol.In contrast, the POST method is not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects (such as financial transactions). In some cases this may be desirable, but in other cases this could be due to an accident, such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request, or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may resubmit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.Note that whether a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other nonidempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. Ignoring this recommendation, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.The TRACE method can be used as part of a class of attacks known as crosssite tracing; for that reason, common security advice is for it to be disabled in the server configuration. Microsoft IIS supports a proprietary \"TRACK\" method, which behaves similarly, and which is likewise recommended to be disabled ",
"Solution": "Verify that the application accepts only a defined set of HTTP request methods, such as GET and POST and unused methods are explicitly blocked/disabled. "

Whenever you are using a positive validation model you are simply checking for the input you were expecting as defined in your application\u2019s operation, for example:Let''s say you have a form and were expecting it to return the value of a checkbox. This would be a fixed value, yes or no? Whenever the value diverges from the expected input in the applications operation you can assume there was an intercepting proxy tampering these values and act accordingly to it.  Same goes for whenever you were expecting just a string, integer, alphanumeric character or even special strings such as names as O\u2019Reily. This method also makes your code clear, transparent and highly maintainable. ",
"Solution": "First there must be a client side input validation method as you would apply to the server side. This means you should also apply input rejection as well as typecasting and such. This is to prevent users from being attacked by XSS attacks which are undetectable by the server."

"title": "TLS certificate public key pinning",
"Description": "Pinning is the process of associating a host with their expected X509 certificate or public key. Once a certificate or public key is known or seen for a host, the certificate or public key is associated or ''pinned'' to the host. If more than one certificate or public key is acceptable, then the program holds a pinset (taking from Jon Larimer and Kenny Root Google I/O talk). In this case, the advertised identity must match one of the elements in the pinset. ",
"Solution": "The idea is to reuse the existing protocols and infrastructure, but use them in a hardened manner. For reuse, a program would keep doing the things it used to do when establishing a secure connection.To harden the channel, the program would take advantage of the OnConnect callback offered by a library, framework or platform. In the callback, the program would verify the remote host''s identity by validating its certificate or public key. While pinning does not have to occur in an OnConnect callback, it is often most convenient because the underlying connection information is readily available.For more extended information on different types of implementation please see: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning "

"Description": "In cryptography, forward secrecy (FS; also known as perfect forward secrecy, or PFS) is a property of keyagreement protocols ensuring that a session key derived from a set of longterm keys cannot be compromised if one of the longterm keys is compromised in the future. The key used to protect the transmission of data must not be used to derive any additional keys, and if the key used to protect the transmission of data is derived from some other keying material, then that material must not be used to derive any more keys. In this way, compromise of a single key permits access only to data protected by that single key. ",
"Solution": "In the beginning SSL handshake, the client sends a list of supported cipher suites (among other things). The server then picks one of the cipher suites, based on a ranking, and tells the client which one they will be using.This step is the one that determines whether or not the future connection will have perfect forward secrecy. Note that, at this point, certificates have not entered the picture at all. This is because whether or not a connection has perfect forward secrecy is determined by how the session key is derived. And how the session key is derived is determined by the cipher suite in use. So, the cipher suites that use ephemeral DiffieHellman (DHE) or the elliptic curve variant (ECDHE) will have perfect forward secrecy while the other options will not. "

"Description": "OCSP stapling, formally known as the TLS Certificate Status Request extension, is an alternative approach to the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for checking the revocation status of X.509 digital certificates. It allows the presenter of a certificate to bear the resource cost involved in providing OCSP responses by appending (\"stapling\") a timestamped OCSP response signed by the CA to the initial TLS Handshake, eliminating the need for clients to contact the CA ",
"Solution": "Stapling basically means that the certificate holder queries the OCSP server themselves at regular intervals, obtaining a signed timestamped OCSP response. When the site''s visitors attempt to connect to the site, this response is included (\"stapled\") with the TLS/SSL Handshake via the Certificate Status Request extension response (note: the TLS client must explicitly include a Certificate Status Request extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSL handshake message). While it may appear that allowing the site operator to control verification responses would allow a fraudulent site to issue false verification for a revoked certificate, the stapled responses can''t be forged as they need to be directly signed by the certificate authority, not the server. If the client does not receive a stapled response, it will just contact the OCSP server by itself. However, if the client receives an invalid stapled response, it will abort the connection. The only increased risk of OCSP stapling is that the notification of revocation for a certificate may be delayed until the lastsigned OCSP response expires.For more detailed information about Specification, Deployment, and limitation visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling "

This vulnerability occurs, for example, when a page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is not properly sanitized, allowing directory traversal characters (such as dotdotslash) to be injected. Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, we should keep in mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others. ",
"Solution": "The most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing usersubmitted input to any filesystem/framework API. If this is not possible the application can maintain a white list of files, that may be included on the page, and then use an identifier (for example the index number) to access the selected file. Any request containing an invalid identifier has to be rejected, in this way, there is no attack surface for malicious users to manipulate the path.Also, disable the opportunity for the application to load remote resources.

"title": "Content security policy headers",
"Description": "The main use of the content security policy header is to, detect, report, and reject XSS attacks. The core issue in relation to XSS attacks is the browser''s inability to distinguish between a script that''s intended to be part of your application, and a script that''s been maliciously injected by a thirdparty. With the use of CSP(Content Security policy), we can tell the browser which script is safe to execute and which scripts are most likely been injected by an attacker. ",
"Solution": "A best practice for implementing CSP in your application would be to externalize all JavaScript within the web pages.So this:     ```     <script>       function doSomething() {         alert(''Something!'');       } \t</script>\t<button onclick=''doSomething();''>foobar!</button> ``` Must become this: ``` \t<script src=''doSomething.js''></script> \t<button id=''somethingToDo''>Let''s foobar!</button> ``` The header for this code could look something like:     ```     ContentSecurityPolicy: defaultsrc''self''; objectsrc''none''; scriptsrc''https://mycdn.com''     ``` Since it is not entirely realistic to implement all JavaScript on external pages we can apply sort of a crosssite request forgery token to your inline JavaScript. This way the browser can again distinguish the difference between code which is part of the application against probable malicious injected code, in CSP this is called the ''nonce''. Of course, this method is also very applicable on your existing code and designs. Now, to use this nonce you have to supply your inline script tags with the nonce attribute. Firstly, it''s important that the nonce changes for each response. Otherwise, the nonce would become guessable. So it should also contain a high entropy and should be hard to predict. Similar to the operation of the CSRF tokens, the nonce becomes impossible for the attacker to predict making it difficult to execute a successful XSS attack. Inline JavaScript example containing nonce: \t``` \t<script nonce=sfsdf03nceI23wlsgle9h3sdd21>     <! Your javscript code >     </script>     ``` Matching header example:     ```     ContentSecurityPolicy: scriptsrc ''noncesfsdf03nceI23wlsgle9h3sdd21''     ``` There is a whole lot more to learn about the CSP header for indepth implementation in your application. This knowledge base item just scratches the surface and it would be highly recommended to gain more indepth knowledge about this powerful header Very Important: When applying the CSP header, although it blocks XSS attacks. Your application still remains vulnerable to HTML and other code injections. So this is not a substitute for, validation, sanitizing and encoding of userinput. "

This builds trust and makes it harder for attackers to impersonate different users.Web Services Security (WSSecurity, WSS) is an extension to SOAP to apply security to  Web services. It is a member of the Web service specifications and was published by OASIS.The protocol specifies how integrity and confidentiality can be enforced on messages and allows  the communication of various security token formats, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML),  Kerberos, and X.509. Its main focus is the use of XML Signature and XML Encryption to provide endtoend security. ",
"Solution": "WSSecurity describes three main mechanisms:How to sign SOAP messages to assure integrity. Signed messages also provide nonrepudiation. How to encrypt SOAP messages to assure confidentiality. How to attach security tokens to ascertain the sender''s identity. The specification allows a variety of signature formats, encryption algorithms and multiple trust domains, and is open to various security token models, such as:X.509 certificates, Kerberos tickets, User ID/Password credentials, SAML Assertions, and customdefined tokens. The token formats and semantics are defined in the associated profile documents.WSSecurity incorporates security features in the header of a SOAP message, working in the application layer.These mechanisms by themselves do not provide a complete security solution for Web services. Instead, this specification is a building block that can be used in conjunction with other Web service extensions and higherlevel applicationspecific protocols to accommodate a wide variety of security models and security technologies. In general, WSS by itself does not provide any guarantee of security. When implementing and using the framework and syntax, it is up to the implementor to ensure that the result is not vulnerable.Key management, trust bootstrapping, federation and agreement on the technical details (ciphers, formats, algorithms) is outside the scope of WSSecurity. Use cases:Endtoend security If a SOAP intermediary is required, and the intermediary is not more or less trusted, messages need to be signed and optionally encrypted. This might be the case of an applicationlevel proxy at a network perimeter that will terminate TCP (transmission control protocol) connections.Nonrepudiation One method for nonrepudiation is to write transactions to an audit trail that is subject to specific security safeguards. Digital signatures, which WSSecurity supports, provide a more direct and verifiable nonrepudiation proof.Alternative transport bindings Although almost all SOAP services implement HTTP bindings, in theory other bindings such as JMS or SMTP could be used; in this case endtoend security would be required.Reverse proxy/common security token Even if the web service relies upon transport layer security, it might be required for the service to know about the end user, if the service is relayed by a (HTTP) reverse proxy. A WSS header could be used to convey the end user''s token, vouched for by the reverse proxy. "

It also prevents HTTPS click through prompts on browsers.However, there is still a window where a user who has a fresh install, or who wipes out their local state, is vulnerable. This is due to the fact that the browser is not yet aware of the fact if the application is trying to connect to supports HSTS. Whenever you are added to the preload list, the application its preference is hardcoded into the browser and all first initial connections will always be made by HTTPS. ",

Serve a valid certificate. 2. Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS on the same host, if you are listening on port 80. 3. Serve all subdomains over HTTPS.     In particular, you must support HTTPS for the www subdomain if a DNS record for that subdomain exists. 5. Serve an HSTS header on the base domain for HTTPS requests:     The maxage must be at least eighteen weeks (10886400 seconds).     The includeSubDomains directive must be specified.     The preload directive must be specified.     If you are serving an additional redirect from your HTTPS site, that redirect must still have the HSTS      header (rather than the page it redirects to).Now the following parameter can be added to the HSTS header,maintained by Chrome (and used by Firefox and Safari), then use:     StrictTransportSecurity: maxage=31536000; includeSubDomains; preloadThe ''preload'' flag indicates the site owner''s consent to have their domain preloaded. The site owner still needs to then go and submit the domain to the list. CAUTION:Make sure to have a perfectly smooth certification management. Whenever there is no valid certificate, the application can not be downgraded temporarily over HTTP. The failing of the TLS certificate will lead to a DOS since HSTS does not allow the application to be visited over HTTP "

This results in an insecure direct object reference flaw. Testers can easily manipulate parameter  values to detect such flaws and code analysis quickly shows whether authorization is properly verified.The most classic example: The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:String query = \"SELECT * FROM accts WHERE account = ?\"; PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query , ... ); pstmt.setString( 1, request.getParameter(\"acct\")); ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();The attacker simply modifies the \u2018acct\u2019 parameter in their browser to send whatever  account number they want.

Today, the most popular data format for serializing data is JSON. Before that, it was XML.However, many programming languages offer a native capability for serializing objects. These native formats usually offer more features than JSON or XML, including customizability of the serialization process.Unfortunately, the features of these native deserialization mechanisms can be repurposed for malicious effect when operating on untrusted data. Attacks against deserializers have been found to allow denialofservice, access control, and remote code execution (RCE) attacks.  ",
"Solution": "Verify that serialized objects use integrity checks or are encrypted to prevent hostile object creation or data tampering.A great reduction of risk is achieved by avoiding native (de)serialization formats. By switching to a  pure data format like JSON or XML, you lessen the chance of custom deserialization logic being repurposed  towards malicious ends.Many applications rely on a datatransfer object pattern that involves creating a separate domain of  objects for the explicit purpose data transfer. Of course, it''s still possible that the application  will make security mistakes after a pure data object is parsed.If the application knows before deserialization which messages will need to be processed,  they could sign them as part of the serialization process.

"Solution": "Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) will grant or deny user requests based on arbitrary  attributes of the user and arbitrary attributes of the object, and environment conditions  that may be globally recognized and more relevant to the policies at hand. Once you have chosen a specific access control design pattern, it is often difficult and time consuming to reengineer access control in your application with a new pattern. Access Control is one of the main areas of application security design that must be thoroughly designed up front,  especially when addressing requirements like multitenancy and horizontal (data dependent) access control.  Ideally we want to move from here: ``` if (user.hasRole(\"ADMIN\")) || (user.hasRole(\"MANAGER\")) {    deleteAccount(); } ```To here:``` if (user.hasAccess(\"DELETE_ACCOUNT\")) {    deleteAccount(); } ```This is becuase the latter is more manageble over time.For more information please refer to the OWASP top 10 pro active controls.https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_ControlsOWASP pro active controls chapter C7 \"Enforce Access Controls\""

In particular, ensure that there is a gap between the threat vectors  that have direct access to the data and the threat vectors that have direct access to the keys.  This implies that keys should not be stored on the application or web server  (assuming that application attackers are part of the relevant threat model).A key vault helps secure, store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates and, encryption keys for protecting secrets and other sensitive data.  Imagine the use of a keyvault in the following scenario''s* Running a docker container and provisioning it with secrets over CLI * Checking in API keys in your source repositories * Encrypting sensitive data at restVault provides encryption as a service with centralized key management to simplify encrypting data  in transit and at rest across clouds and datacenters.a Vault can be used to encrypt/decrypt data that is stored elsewhere. The primary use of this is to allow applications to encrypt their data while still storing it in the primary data store.The benefit of this is that developers do not need to worry about how to properly encrypt data. The responsibility of encryption is on Vault and the security team managing it, and developers just encrypt/decrypt data as needed. ",

"Description": "The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security.Confidentiality In information security, confidentiality \"is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.\"  While similar to \"privacy,\" the two words aren''t interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality  is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft,  password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.Integrity In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic ACID model of transaction processing. Information security systems typically provide message integrity along side to confidentiality.Availability For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information,  the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly. High availability systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures,  and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denialofservice attacks,  such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.  ",

Some users find it hard to devise \"good\" passwords that are  also easy to remember, so if people are required to choose many passwords because they have  to change them often, they end up using much weaker passwords; the policy also encourages  users to write passwords down. Also, if the policy prevents a user from repeating a recent password,  this requires that there is a database in existence of everyone''s recent passwords (or their hashes)  instead of having the old ones erased from memory. Finally, users may change their password repeatedly within a few minutes, and then change back to the one they really want to use, circumventing the  password change policy altogether. ",

The details of how this is done depends on whether it is a hardware or  software exception and how the software exception is implemented. Some exceptions,  especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted.Alternative approaches to exception handling in software are error checking,  which maintains normal program flow with later explicit checks for contingencies  reported using special return values or some auxiliary global variable  such as C''s errno or floating point status flags; or input validation to preemptively  filter exceptional cases.

Though backups represent a simple form of disaster recovery  and should be part of any disaster recovery plan, backups by themselves should not be considered a complete disaster recovery plan. One reason for this is that not all backup systems are able to reconstitute a computer system or other complex configuration such as a computer cluster,  active directory server, or database server by simply restoring data from a backup.In order to always poses over the latest state of your data it is recommended to do active syncing between the application server and the backup service.

Several versions of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). Websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers.The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications.[2]:3 When secured by TLS, connections between a client  (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) should have one or more of the following properties:The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the data transmitted.  The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a shared  secret that was negotiated at the start of the session. The server and client negotiate  the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted.  The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be  obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable  (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using publickey cryptography.  This authentication can be made optional, but is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically the server).The connection is reliable because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using  a message authentication code to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during transmission.In addition to the properties above, careful configuration of TLS can provide additional privacyrelated properties  such as forward secrecy, ensuring that any future disclosure of encryption keys cannot be used to decrypt any TLS communications recorded in the past ",

Moreover, attackers with local privileges on the user''s machine are able to access these storages and possibly compromise the session of the users. ",
"Solution": "Sensitive data (like session tokens or Personal Identifiable Information) should never be stored in clientside storages.

An Identity Provider makes possible to authenticate the user to registered services without actually requiring them to login again for every application.When deploying a Credential Service Provider it is necessary to verify that the Credential Service Provider and Relying Parties handle the session management mechanisms in a secure way.  ",
"Solution": "To ensure a properly implemented connection between the Identity Provider and the Relying Parties, it is necessary to validate the session management in both sides. In particular, the Relying Parties have to specify to the IdP the maximum authentication timeframe for inactive sessions. After this period, the IdP has to reauthenticate the subscriber (i.e. the user) again. On the other hand, is up to the IdP to inform the Relying Parties of the last authentication event of a user. With this information, the Relying Parties can determine if they need to force the user to authenticate again. "

Since we belong to a generation of high speed computers performing these attacks is quite a trivial task for the attackers.  ",
"Solution": "The most effective solution to eliminate offline attacks on password is to enforce the use of strong passwords and very prominently use industry recognized hashing algorithms with a salting mechanism. We hash passwords because in the event an attacker gets read access to our database, we do not want him to retrieve the passwords plain text. A salt is a nonsecret, unique value in the database which is appended (depending on the used algorithm) to the password before it gets hashed.Some of the well known hashing algorithms are as follows:MD5 (Crytographically Broken), SHA1 (Crytographically Broken), SHA2, SHA3, PBKDF2, bcrypt (defacto standard) and scrypt.

The aim of the function is to create a key in such a way that dictionary attacks (where the attacker just tries a range of possible passwords) are unfeasible. To do this, PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function (PRF) to the password many times. Additionally, the function can be given a \u201csalt\u201d parameter to make each key derivation operation unique. A developer using PBKDF2 must carefully choose parameter values for the salt, the PRF, and the number of iterations, i.e. the number of times the PRF will be applied to the password when deriving the key.

Typically, a customer wishing to do an online bank transaction will be sent an SMS message by cell phone with a password. This way, any hackers or identity thieves that have access through key loggers or other equipment will not be able to access that particular password, because it is sent over a 3G or 4G wireless network instead of being sent over the Internet.It is worthy to ensure the channel between the communicating parties is through a trusted and secure channel.
