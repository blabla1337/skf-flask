By browsing the application, the attacker looks for absolute links to files stored on the web server. By manipulating variables that reference files with dotdotslash (../); sequences and its variations, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and critical system files, limited by system operational access control. The attacker uses  ../../ sequences to move up to root directory, thus permitting navigation through the file system. This attack can be executed with an external malicious code injected on the path, like the Resource Injection attack.\n\n\n Solution:\n\nThe most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing\nusersubmitted input to any filesystem/framework API. If this is not possible the application\ncan maintain a white list of files, that may be included on the page, and then use an identifier\n(for example the index number) to access the selected file. Any request containing an invalid\nidentifier has to be rejected, in this way there is no attack surface for malicious users to\nmanipulate the path.\n\n"}, {"kbID": 3, "title": "XSS injection", "content": " Description:\n\nEvery time the application gets userinput, whether this showing it on screen or processing\nthis data in the application background, these parameters should be escaped for malicious\ncode in order to prevent crosssite scripting injections.\nWhen an attacker gains the possibility to perform an XSS injection,\nhe is given the opportunity to inject HTML and JavaScript code directly into the\napplication. This could lead to accounts being compromised by stealing session cookies or directly \naffect the operation of the target application. \n\nAltough templating engines(razor, twig, jinja, etc) and contextaware applications(Angular, React, etc)\ndo a lot of auto escaping for you. These frameworks should always be validated for effectiveness.\n\n\n Solution:\n\nIn order to prevent XSS injections, all userinput should be escaped or encoded.\nYou could start by sanitizing userinput as soon as it is inserted into the application,\nby preference using a so called whitelisting method.\nThis means you should not check for malicious content like the tags or anything,\nbut only allow the expected input. Every input which is outside of the intended operation\nof the application should immediately be detected and login rejected.\nDo not try to help use the input in any way because that could introduce a new type of attack by converting characters. \n\nThe second step would be encoding all the parameters or userinput before putting this in\nyour html with encoding libraries specially designed for this purpose.\n\nYou should take into consideration that there are several contexts for encoding userinput for\nescaping XSS injections. These contexts are amongst others:\n\n* HTML encoding, is for whenever your userinput is displayed directly into your HTML.\n* HTML attribute encoding, is the type of encoding/escaping that should be applied \n  whenever your user input is displayed into the attribute of your HTML tags.\n* HTML URL encoding, this type of encoding/escaping should be applied to whenever you are using userinput into a HREF tag.\n\nJavaScript encoding should be used whenever parameters are rendered via JavaScript; your application will detect normal injections in the first instant.

Command injection attacks are\npossible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data\n(forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack,\nthe attackersupplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges\nof the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to\ninsufficient input validation. This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code\ninjection allows the attacker to adds his own code that is then executed by the application.\nIn Code Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application\nwithout the necessity of executing system commands.\n\n Solution:\n\nUserinput that is used in a shell command should not contain dangerous characters.\nA blacklist of characters is not a good option because it may be difficult to think of\nall of the characters to validate against.

For example, this attack could result\nin a transfer of funds, changing a password, or purchasing an item in the users context.\nIn effect, CSRF attacks are used by an attacker to make a target system perform a\nfunction (funds Transfer, form submission etc.) via the targets browser without\nknowledge of the target user at least until the unauthorised function has been committed.\n\n Solution:\n\nTo arm an application against automated attacks and tooling you need to use unique tokens\nwhich are included into the forms of an application, API calls or AJAX requests.  \nAny state changing operation requires a secure random token (e.g CSRF token) to prevent\nagainst CSRF attacks. Characteristics of a CSRF Token are a unique, large random\nvalue generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n\nThe CSRF token is then added as a hidden field for forms and validated on the sever side whenever\na user is sending a request to the server.\n\nNote :\nWhenever the application is an REST service and is using tokens such as JWT tokens, whenever these tokens are being sent\nin the application headers rather than stored in cookies the application should not be suspectible to CSRF attacks for a succesfull CSRF attacke depends on the browsers cookie jar.\n"}, {"kbID": 6, "title": "XXE injections", "content": " Description:\n\nProcessing of an Xml eXternal Entity containing tainted data may lead to the disclosure of\nconfidential information and other system impacts.\nThe XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document.\nThe standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type.\n\nThere exists a specific type of entity, an external general parsed entity often shortened\nto an external entity, that can access local or remote content via a declared system\nidentifier and the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not\naccessible by the application.

The XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There exists a specific type of entity, an external general parsed entity often shortened to an external entity that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the entity.\nThe XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application. Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\nSince the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via HTTP(s) requests. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to clientside memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability if too many threads or processes are not released.\n\n\n Solution:\n\nDisable the XML DTD (Document Type Definition) parsing.

This could result in the execution of arbitrary commands such as granting permissions to unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree. The same advanced exploitation techniques available in SQL Injection can be similarly applied in LDAP Injection.\n\n Solution:\n\nThe best way to prevent LDAP injection is to use a positive validation scheme for ensuring that the data going into your queries does not contain any attacks. However, in some cases, it is necessary to include special characters in the input that is passed into an LDAP query. In this case, using escaping can prevent the LDAP interpreter from thinking those special characters are actually part of the LDAP query.\n"}, {"kbID": 12, "title": "SSI injections", "content": " Description:\n\nWeb servers usually give developers the ability to add small pieces of dynamic code inside\nstatic HTML pages, without having to deal with fullfledged serverside\nor clientside languages.\n\nThis feature is incarnated by the ServerSide Includes (SSI).\nThe attacker will try to inject code into the application that will\nbe interpreted by SSI mechanisms.

You must validate the metadata extremely carefully before using it.\n\nThe other class of problem is with the file size or content.\nAn attacker can easily craft a valid image file with PHP code inside.\n\n Solution:\n\n Uploaded files always need to be placed outside the document root of the webserver\n Check to not accept large files that could fill up storage or cause a denial of service attack\n Check the userinput(filename) for having the right allowed extensions such as .jpg, .png etc\n  Note: when checking these extensions always make sure your application validates the last\n  possible extension so an attacker could not simply inject \".jpg.php\" and bypass your\n  validation\n\n Check the userinput(filename) for containing possible path traversal patterns in order to prevent him from uploading outside of the intended directory.\n\nYou may also want to check if the filenames do already exist before uploading in order to\nprevent the overwriting of files.\n\nAlso for serving the files back there needs to be a file handler function that can select\nthe file based on an identifier that will serve the file back towards the user.\n\nMost developers also do a mimetype check. This is a good protection however not\nwhenever you are checking this mimetype through the post request.

Sometimes this is due to bad\ndevelopment, but it can be the result of an attack or some other service your application relies on failing.\n\nAll code paths that can cause an exception to be thrown should check for success in order for the exception \nnot to be thrown.\n\n Solution:\n\nWe should use a localized description string in every exception, a friendly error reason such as \u201cSystem Error \u2013 Please try again later\u201d. When the user sees an error message, it will be derived from this description string of the exception that was thrown, and never from the exception class which may contain a stack trace, line number where the error occurred, \nclass name or method name.\n\nDo not expose sensitive information in exception messages.

A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key\nby the named subject of the certificate. Sometimes it happens that a CA goes bad and is\nrevoked from the browser. This will lead to untrusted TLS connections if your application\nuses an issued certificate from this CA.\n\nA selfsigned certificate is an identity certificate that is signed by the same entity whose identity it certifies. This term has nothing to do with the identity of the person or organization that actually performed the signing procedure. In technical terms a selfsigned certificate is one signed with its own private key.\n\nIn typical public key infrastructure (PKI) arrangements, a digital signature from a certificate authority (CA) attests that a particular public key certificate is valid. Each CA has one or more root keys; and the certificates associated with those public keys are \"trust anchors\" that use a special type of selfsigned certificates. Establishing trust of the CA root certificate is dependent upon procedures beyond checking its digital signature.\n\n Solution:\n\nIn a CA based PKI system, the CA must be trusted by both parties. This is usually accomplished by placing the CA certificates in a whitelist of trusted certificates. For example, web browsers developers may use procedures specified by the CA/Browser Forum, or a private CA''s certificate may be placed in the firmware of an embedded system. The trust issues of an entity accepting a new selfsigned certificate, is similar to the issues of an entity trusting the addition of a new CA certificate. The parties in a selfsigned PKI must establish trust with each other (using procedures outside the PKI), and confirm the accurate transfer of public keys (e.g. compare the hash out of band).\n\nThere are many subtle differences between CA signed and selfsigned certificates, especially in the amount of trust that can be placed in the security assertions of the certificate. Some CAs can verify the identity of the person to whom they issue a certificate; for example the US military issues their Common Access Cards in person, with multiple forms of other ID. The CA can attest identity values like these by including them in the signed certificate. The entity that validates the certificate can trust the information in that certificate, to the same extent that they trust the CA that signed it (and by implication, the security procedures the CA used to verify the attested information).\n\nWith a selfsigned certificate by contrast, trust of the values in the certificate are more complicated because the entity possesses the signing key, and can always generate a new certificate with different values. For example, the validity dates of a selfsigned certificate might not be trusted because the entity could always create and sign a new certificate that contained a valid date range. The values in a selfsigned certificate can be trusted when the following conditions are true: the values were (outofband) verified when the selfsigned was formally trusted, and there is a method to verify the selfsigned certificate has not changed after it was trusted. For example, the procedure of trusting a selfsigned certificate includes a manual verification of validity dates, and a hash of the certificate is incorporated into the white list. When the certificate is presented for an entity to validate, they first verify the hash of the certificate matches the reference hash in the whitelist, and if they match (indicating the selfsigned certificate is the same as the one that was formally trusted) then the certificate''s validity dates can be trusted. Special treatment of X.509 certificate fields for selfsigned certificate can be found in RFC 3280.\n\nVerify that connections to and from the server use trusted TLS certificates. Where internally generated or selfsigned certificates are used, the server must be configured to only trust specific internal CAs and specific selfsigned certificates. All others should be rejected.\n"}, {"kbID": 102, "title": "All connections should be TLS", "content": " Description:\n\nWhenever an application provides TLS, all connections should be TLS otherwise the\nencryption will be lost.\n\n Solution:\n\nVerify that TLS is used for all connections\n(including both external and backend connections) that are using authentication tokens or\nthat involve sensitive data or functions.\nThis should also be enforced in the application itself wherever possible,\nfor example: Secure flags on cookies, HSTS, certificate pinning etc.\n"}, {"kbID": 103, "title": "Log TLS connection failures", "content": " Description:\n\nFailing TLS connections should always be logged.

It''s creating\nan extra layer of security where an attacker first needs to break out from.\n\n Solution:\n\nExamples of sandbox implementations include the following:\nA jail: networkaccess restrictions, and a restricted file system namespace. Jails are most commonly used in virtual hosting.\nRulebased execution gives users full control over what processes are started, spawned (by other applications), or allowed to inject code into other applications and have access to the net, by having the system assign access levels to users or programs according to a set of determined rules. It also can control file/registry security (what programs can read and write to the file system/registry). In such an environment, viruses and Trojans have fewer opportunities of infecting a computer. The SELinux and AppArmor security frameworks are two such implementations for Linux.\nVirtual machines emulate a complete host computer, on which a conventional operating system may boot and run as on actual hardware. The guest operating system runs sandboxed in the sense that it does not function natively on the host and can only access host resources through the emulator.\nSandboxing on native hosts: Security researchers rely heavily on sandboxing technologies to analyze malware behavior  By creating an environment that mimics or replicates the targeted desktops, researchers can evaluate how malware infects and compromises a target host. Numerous malware analysis services are based on the sandboxing technology.\nCapability systems can be thought of as a finegrained sandboxing mechanism, in which programs are given opaque tokens when spawned and have the ability to do specific things based on what tokens they hold. Capabilitybased implementations can work at various levels, from kernel to userspace. An example of capabilitybased userlevel sandboxing involves HTML rendering in a Web browser.\nSecure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a sandbox built in the Linux kernel. When activated, seccomp only allows the write(), read(), exit(), and sigreturn() system calls.\nHTML5 has a \"sandbox\" attribute for use with iframes.\nJava virtual machines include a sandbox to restrict the actions of untrusted code, such as a Java applet.\nThe .NET Common Language Runtime provides Code Access Security to enforce restrictions on a untrusted code.\n\n```\n"}, {"kbID": 107, "title": "Repudiation attack", "content": " Description:\n\nA repudiation attack happens when an application or system does not adopt controls to\nproperly track and log users actions, thus permitting malicious manipulation or forging\nthe identification of new actions.

CORS defines the protocol to use a web browser and a server to determine whether a crossorigin request is allowed. In order to accomplish this goal, there are a few HTTP headers involved in this process, that are supported by all major browsers:\n\n Origin\n AccessControlRequestMethod\n AccessControlRequestHeaders\n AccessControlAllowOrigin\n AccessControlAllowCredentials\n AccessControlAllowMethods\n AccessControlAllowHeaders\n\nThings you must consider when using CORS\n\n1. Validate URLs passed to XMLHttpRequest.open. Current browsers allow these URLs to be\ncross domain; this behavior can lead to code injection by a remote attacker.

Instead of solely depending\non role based authentication methods using sessions, we rather want to assign privileges\nto users by means of a DatabaseBased Authentication system.\n\nWe still use sessions in order to identify if the user was logged in correctly, only now\ninstead of assigning that user with a specific role we assign him with privileges to\nverify which actions he is privileged to perform on the system.\n\nAlso, a big pro of this method is, whenever a user has to be assigned fewer privileges\nyour changes will be applied on the fly since the assigning does not depend on the session\nwhich otherwise had to expire first.\n"}, {"kbID": 127, "title": "TLS implementation must operate in an approved mode of operation", "content": " Description:\n\nTo enforce the maximum amount of security out of the TLS implementation it should always\nsuffice the approved mode of operation.\n\n Solution:\n\nSee See http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips1402/FIPS1402IG.pdf\nfor more extended details on how to reach this goal.\n"}, {"kbID": 128, "title": "Character encoding", "content": " Description:\n\nCharacter encoding is the process of mapping characters, numbers and other symbols to a\nstandard format. Typically, this is done to create a message ready for transmission\nbetween sender and receiver. It is, in simple terms, the conversion of characters\n(belonging to different languages like English, Chinese, Greek or any other known language)\ninto bytes. An example of a widely used character encoding scheme is the American\nStandard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) that initially used 7bit codes.\nMore recent examples of encoding schemes would be the Unicode UTF8 and UTF16 computing\nindustry standards. In the space of application security and due to the plethora of\nencoding schemes available, character encoding has a popular misuse. It is being used for\nencoding malicious injection strings in a way that obfuscates them. This can lead to the\nbypass of input validation filters, or take advantage of particular ways in which browsers\nrender encoded text.\n\n Solution:\n\nWhen trying to figure out the character encoding of a resource, user agents will try, in\nthis order:\n\n The HTTP ContentType header sent by the server\n The XML declaration (only for XHTML documents)\n HTML/XHTML meta element.\n\nMake sure this information is provided by your application for the server in order to\nprevent it from guessing the wrong encoding standard, leaving room for injection.\n\n Note:\n\nThese three ways of providing the character encoding of a document are not\nequivalent.\n"}, {"kbID": 129, "title": "HTTP request methods", "content": " Description:\n\nHTTP offers a number of methods that can be used to perform actions on the web server.\nMany of these methods are designed to aid developers in deploying and testing\nHTTP applications. These HTTP methods can be used for nefarious purposes if the web\nserver is misconfigured. It recommended to read about the different available methods, their purposes and\nlimitations.\n\nAvailable method are:\n\nGET\nThe GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)[1] The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, \"Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.\n\nHEAD\nThe HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving metainformation written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.\n\nPOST\nThe POST method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a datahandling process; or an item to add to a database.\n\n\nPUT\nThe PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.\n\n\nDELETE\nThe DELETE method deletes the specified resource.\n\n\nTRACE\nThe TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.\n\nOPTIONS\nThe OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting ''*'' instead of a specific resource.\n\nCONNECT\nThe CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSLencrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.\n\nPATCH\nThe PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.\n\nSome of the methods (for example, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE) are, by convention, defined as safe, which means they are intended only for information retrieval and should not change the state of the server. In other words, they should not have side effects, beyond relatively harmless effects such as logging, web caching, the serving of banner advertisements or incrementing a web counter. Making arbitrary GET requests without regard to the context of the application''s state should therefore be considered safe. However, this is not mandated by the standard, and it is explicitly acknowledged that it cannot be guaranteed.\n\nDespite the prescribed safety of GET requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Therefore, careless or deliberate programming can cause nontrivial changes on the server. This is discouraged, because it can cause problems for web caching, search engines and other automated agents, which can make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as http://example.com/article/1234/delete, which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using GET, would simply delete the article.\n\nBy contrast, methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH are intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as financial transactions or transmission of email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.\n\nMethods PUT and DELETE are defined to be idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request (note that idempotence refers to the state of the system after the request has completed, so while the action the server takes (e.g. deleting a record) or the response code it returns may be different on subsequent requests, the system state will be the same every time). Methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, being prescribed as safe, should also be idempotent, as HTTP is a stateless protocol.\n\nIn contrast, the POST method is not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects (such as financial transactions). In some cases this may be desirable, but in other cases this could be due to an accident, such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request, or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may resubmit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.\n\nNote that whether a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other nonidempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. Ignoring this recommendation, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.\n\nThe TRACE method can be used as part of a class of attacks known as crosssite tracing; for that reason, common security advice is for it to be disabled in the server configuration. Microsoft IIS supports a proprietary \"TRACK\" method, which behaves similarly, and which is likewise recommended to be disabled\n\n Solution:\n\nVerify that the application accepts only a defined set of HTTP request methods, such as\nGET and POST and unused methods are explicitly blocked/disabled.\n"}, {"kbID": 130, "title": "Verbose version information", "content": " Description:\n\nRevealing system data or debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system\nand form a plan of attack.

The attacker again can force the browser to download a file with his own choice of extension and set the content of this file by injecting this directly into the response like filename=evil.bat%0A%0D%0A%0DinsertEvilStringHere\n\nWhenever the user now opens the downloaded file the attacker can gain full control over the target\u2019s device.\n\n\n Solution:\n\nFirst, never use user input directly into your headers since an attacker can now take control over it.\n\nSecondly, you should check if a filename really does exist before presenting it towards the users. You could also create a whitelist of all files which are allowed to be downloaded and terminate requests whenever they do not match.\n\nAlso, you should disable the use of \"path parameters\". It increases the attacker\u2019s attack vector and these parameters also cause a lot of other vulnerabilities.\nAnd last you should sanitize and encode all your userinput as much as possible. Reflective file downloads depend on userinput being reflected in the response header.

When the site''s visitors\nattempt to connect to the site, this response is included (\"stapled\") with the TLS/SSL\nHandshake via the Certificate Status Request extension response (note: the TLS client must\nexplicitly include a Certificate Status Request extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSL\nhandshake message). While it may appear that allowing the site operator to control\nverification responses would allow a fraudulent site to issue false verification for a\nrevoked certificate, the stapled responses can''t be forged as they need to be directly\nsigned by the certificate authority, not the server. If the client does not receive a\nstapled response, it will just contact the OCSP server by itself. However, if the\nclient receives an invalid stapled response, it will abort the connection.

Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, we should keep\nin mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others.\n\n Solution:\n\nThe most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing usersubmitted input to any filesystem/framework API. If this is not possible the application can maintain a white list of files, that may be included on the page, and then use an identifier (for example the index number) to access the selected file.

The core issue in relation to XSS attacks is the browser''s inability to distinguish between a script that''s intended to be part of your application, and a script that''s been maliciously injected by a thirdparty.\nWith the use of CSP(Content Security policy), we can tell the browser which script is safe to execute and which scripts are most likely been injected by an attacker.\n\n Solution:\n\nA best practice for implementing CSP in your application would be to externalize all\nJavaScript within the web pages.\n\nSo this:\n    ```\n    <script>\n      function doSomething() {\n        alert(''Something!'');\n      }\n\t</script>\n\n\t<button onclick=''doSomething();''>foobar!</button>\n```\nMust become this:\n```\n\t<script src=''doSomething.js''></script>\n\t<button id=''somethingToDo''>Let''s foobar!</button>\n```\nThe header for this code could look something like:\n    ```\n    ContentSecurityPolicy: defaultsrc''self''; objectsrc''none''; scriptsrc''https://mycdn.com''\n    ```\nSince it is not entirely realistic to implement all JavaScript on external pages we can apply sort of a crosssite request forgery token to your inline JavaScript. This way the browser can again distinguish the difference between code which is part of the application against probable malicious injected code, in CSP this is called the ''nonce''. Of course, this method is also very applicable on your existing code and designs.\nNow, to use this nonce you have to supply your inline script tags with the nonce attribute. Firstly, it''s important that the nonce changes for each response. Otherwise, the nonce would become guessable. So it should also contain a high entropy and should be hard to predict. Similar to the operation of the CSRF tokens, the nonce becomes impossible for the attacker to predict making it difficult to execute a successful XSS attack.\n\n\nInline JavaScript example containing nonce:\n\t```\n\t<script nonce=sfsdf03nceI23wlsgle9h3sdd21>\n    <! Your javscript code >\n    </script>\n    ```\nMatching header example:\n    ```\n    ContentSecurityPolicy: scriptsrc ''noncesfsdf03nceI23wlsgle9h3sdd21''\n    ```\nThere is a whole lot more to learn about the CSP header for indepth implementation in your application.

This builds trust\nand makes it harder for attackers to impersonate different users.\n\nWeb Services Security (WSSecurity, WSS) is an extension to SOAP to apply security to \nWeb services. It is a member of the Web service specifications and was published by OASIS.\n\nThe protocol specifies how integrity and confidentiality can be enforced on messages and allows \nthe communication of various security token formats, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), \nKerberos, and X.509. Its main focus is the use of XML Signature and XML Encryption to provide endtoend security.\n\n Solution:\n\nWSSecurity describes three main mechanisms:\n\nHow to sign SOAP messages to assure integrity. Signed messages also provide nonrepudiation.\nHow to encrypt SOAP messages to assure confidentiality.\nHow to attach security tokens to ascertain the sender''s identity.\nThe specification allows a variety of signature formats, encryption algorithms and multiple trust domains, and is open to various security token models, such as:\n\nX.509 certificates,\nKerberos tickets,\nUser ID/Password credentials,\nSAML Assertions, and\ncustomdefined tokens.\nThe token formats and semantics are defined in the associated profile documents.\n\nWSSecurity incorporates security features in the header of a SOAP message, working in the application layer.\n\nThese mechanisms by themselves do not provide a complete security solution for Web services. Instead, this specification is a building block that can be used in conjunction with other Web service extensions and higherlevel applicationspecific protocols to accommodate a wide variety of security models and security technologies. In general, WSS by itself does not provide any guarantee of security. When implementing and using the framework and syntax, it is up to the implementor to ensure that the result is not vulnerable.\n\nKey management, trust bootstrapping, federation and agreement on the technical details (ciphers, formats, algorithms) is outside the scope of WSSecurity.\n\n Use cases:\n\nEndtoend security\nIf a SOAP intermediary is required, and the intermediary is not more or less trusted, messages need to be signed and optionally encrypted. This might be the case of an applicationlevel proxy at a network perimeter that will terminate TCP (transmission control protocol) connections.\n\nNonrepudiation\nOne method for nonrepudiation is to write transactions to an audit trail that is subject to specific security safeguards. Digital signatures, which WSSecurity supports, provide a more direct and verifiable nonrepudiation proof.\n\nAlternative transport bindings\nAlthough almost all SOAP services implement HTTP bindings, in theory other bindings such as JMS or SMTP could be used; in this case endtoend security would be required.\n\nReverse proxy/common security token\nEven if the web service relies upon transport layer security, it might be required for the service to know about the end user, if the service is relayed by a (HTTP) reverse proxy. A WSS header could be used to convey the end user''s token, vouched for by the reverse proxy.\n\n\n"}, {"kbID": 196, "title": "Hardware key vault", "content": " Description:\n\nKeys should remain in a protected key vault at all times.

As the user was originally on the correct page they are \nless likely to notice that it has been changed to a phishing site, especially it the site looks the same as the target. \nIf the user authenticates to this new page then their credentials (or other sensitive data) are sent to the phishing site rather than the legitimate one.\n\nAs well as the target site being able to overwrite the target page, any http link can be spoofed to overwrite the target \npage if the user is on an unsecured network, for example a public wifi hotspot. The attack is possible even if the target \nsite is only available via https as the attacker only needs to spoof the http site that is being linked to.\n\n Solution:\n\nTo prevent this issue the following actions are available:\n\nCut the back link between the parent and the child pages:\n  For html link:\n   * To cut this back link then add the attribute rel=\"noopener\" on the \n     tag used to create the link from the parent page to the child page. \n     This attribute value cut the link but, depending on the browser, let referrer\n     information be present in the request to the child page.\n   * To remove also the referrer information then use this attribute value: rel=\"noopener noreferrer\".\n  For javascript window.open function, add the values noopener,noreferrer in the windowFeatures parameter of the window.open function.\n\nAs the behavior using the elements above is different between the browsers either using html \nlink or javascript to open a window (or tab) then use this configuration to maximize the cross supports:\n\n* For html link, add the attribute rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" for every links.\n* For Javascript, use this function to open a window (or tab):\n\n  function openPopup(url, name, windowFeatures){\n    //Open the popup and set the opener and referrer policy instruction\n    var newWindow = window.open(url, name, ''noopener,noreferrer,'' + windowFeatures);\n    //Reset the opener link\n    newWindow.opener = null;\n  }\n  \nAdd the HTTP response header ReferrerPolicy: noreferrer the every HTTP responses send by the application\n(Header ReferrerPolicy information).

Testers can easily manipulate parameter \nvalues to detect such flaws and code analysis quickly shows whether authorization is properly verified.\n\nThe most classic example:\nThe application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:\n\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM accts WHERE account = ?\";\nPreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query , ... );\npstmt.setString( 1, request.getParameter(\"acct\"));\nResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();\n\nThe attacker simply modifies the \u2018acct\u2019 parameter in their browser to send whatever \naccount number they want. If not verified, the attacker can access any user\u2019s account, instead of \nonly the intended customer\u2019s account.\n\nhttp://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct\n\n Solution:\n\nPreventing insecure direct object references requires selecting an approach \nfor protecting each user accessible object (e.g., object number, filename):\n\nUse per user or session indirect object references. This prevents attackers from directly \ntargeting unauthorized resources. For example, instead of using the resource\u2019s database key, \na drop down list of six resources authorized for the current user could use the numbers 1 to 6 to \nindicate which value the user selected. The application has to map the peruser indirect reference \nback to the actual database key on the server.\n\nCheck access.

This was due to the fact\nthat it only escaped string based SQL injection. \n\nNow, if this application also had additional checks to validate if the value of \nthe $_GET[''id''] parameter was indeed as expected an integer and rejected if this condition was false, \nthe attack would effectively been mitigated.\n\n\n Solution:\n\nAll the user supplied input that works outside of the intended opteration of the application\nshould be rejected by the application.\n\nSyntax and Semantic Validity\nAn application should check that data is both syntactically and semantically \nvalid (in that order) before using it in any way (including displaying it back to the user). \n\nSyntax validity, means that the data is in the form that is expected. For example, an application\nmay allow a user to select a fourdigit \u201caccount ID\u201d to perform some kind of operation. \nThe application should assume the user is entering a SQL injection payload, and should \ncheck that the data entered by the user is exactly four digits in length, and consists only of numbers \n(in addition to utilizing proper query parameterization).\n\nSemantic validity, includes only accepting input that is within an acceptable range for the\ngiven application functionality and context.

Today, the most popular data format for serializing data is JSON. Before that, it was XML.\n\nHowever, many programming languages offer a native capability for serializing objects. These native formats\nusually offer more features than JSON or XML, including customizability of the serialization process.\n\nUnfortunately, the features of these native deserialization mechanisms can be repurposed for malicious\neffect when operating on untrusted data. Attacks against deserializers have been found to allow denialofservice,\naccess control, and remote code execution (RCE) attacks.\n\n\n Solution:\n\nVerify that serialized objects use integrity checks or are encrypted to prevent hostile object creation or data tampering.\n\nA great reduction of risk is achieved by avoiding native (de)serialization formats. By switching to a \npure data format like JSON or XML, you lessen the chance of custom deserialization logic being repurposed \ntowards malicious ends.\n\nMany applications rely on a datatransfer object pattern that involves creating a separate domain of \nobjects for the explicit purpose data transfer.
