# Open forwards & redirects
-------

## Example:


	// When using forwards & redirects you should make sure the URL is being explicitly
	// declared in the code and cannot be manipulated by an attacker like:

	redirect_to params[:redirect]

	// Generally you should avoid getting input into the redirect which could contain
	// userinput by any means. if for any reason this may not be feasible than you
	// should make a whitelist input validation for the redirect

	def redirecting
		if params[:redirect] =~ %r{^https\:\/\/trusted-site.com\/.+$}
			redirect_to params[:redirect]
		end
	end
