# Anti clickjacking headers
-------

## Example:


    // Ruby on Rails sets X-Frame-Options header with "SAMEORIGIN" option by default.
    // If in your case it doesn't or you want to enforce "DENY" options, you can add that headers manually.

    // Add the following code to APP_DIR/config/environments/production.rb

    config.action_dispatch.default_headers = {
      'X-Frame-Options' => 'DENY' // this will completely prevent your page from being displayed in an iframe.
    }

    // OR

    config.action_dispatch.default_headers = {
      'X-Frame-Options' => 'SAMEORIGIN' // this will completely prevent your page from being displayed in an iframe on other sites.
    }
