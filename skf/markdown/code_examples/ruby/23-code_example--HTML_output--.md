# HTML output
-------

## Example:


	// Whenever user input is displayed in the application, whether, as content or a parameter value
	// submitted towards the url, all user input should be properly escaped to prevent XSS injections.

	// For normal output it is recommended use sanitize with the most restrict options
	<%= sanitize(test, tags: [], attributes: []) %>

	// Security consists of different layers of protection, in order to guarantee the integrity
	// of your application. This means that the value submitted from the user should
	// already be sanitized before being submitted towards the database in order to prevent XSS.
	// As an example, you are expecting only alphanumerical value here:

	unless /^[azAZ09]+$/ =~ sanitize(input, tags: [], attributes: [])
		//do logout here
	end

	// This type of approach should be used whenever you are allowing userinput in
	// your DOM like for example, let's say a user was allowed to upload an image and
	// set an alt text. when you do not sanitize his input a possible attack string could be:

	this is an image" onload="alert('XSS');"

	// whenever this string now is added to the users image this will be the outcome, leading
	// to xss:

	<img src="http://image.com/image.jpg" alt="this is an image" onload="alert('XSS')"" />

	// After this sanitation malicious code can no longer exist in the post_params array.

	// Another possibility for attackers to execute an XSS injection, is to pass malicious code directly
	// into the URL by means of a "href", e.g.:
	// javascript:alert(document.cookie);
	// or
	// data:text/html;base64,base64xssinjection

	// In the following scenario escaping with sanitize() is not sufficient to block the injection.
	// By checking the URL to see if it starts with either http:// or https:// whenever a link has
	// been submitted to the web application by a user.
