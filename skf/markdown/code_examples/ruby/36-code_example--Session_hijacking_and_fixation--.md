# Session hijacking and fixation
-------

## Example:


    // In order to secure your session, you have to turn on SECURE and HTTPONLY cookies' flags
    // More info in: "Session cookies HTTPOnly" and "Secure session cookies"

    // Turn on `force_ssl` in config/environments/production.rb
    Rails.application.configure do
      // redirects all HTTP to HTTPS and also adds secure flag to your cookies
      config.force_ssl = true

      config.ssl_options = {
        // HTTP Strict Transport Security configuration
        hsts: {
          // default
          expires: 180.days,

          // default - if all present and future subdomains will be HTTPS
          subdomains: true,

          // Recommended: If the site owner would like their domain to be included in the HSTS preload list
          // defaults to false
          preload: true
        }
      }

      // more information can be found here: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/SSL.html
    end

    // After that add :trackable symbol to the devise configuration in users' model

    // For example:
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :posts

      // Be sure that :trackable is added
      devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
            :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :secure_validatable
    end

    // Now update controllers that need authenticated users to perform actions.
    class ContollerWithAuthenticatedUsers < ApplicationController
      before_action :authenticate_user!
      before_action :check_ip

      private
      // After this modification current users' IP address will be compared to
      // the last IP that was used to log in on the account. If they dont match - 
      // user will be warned. This check will be performed every single user action.
      def check_ip
        if current_user.last_sign_in_ip != request.remote_ip
          flash[:warning] = "There are other active sessions on other IP addresses. " +
          "Your session could be hijacked. Press logout in order to authenticate again " +
          "for security reasons!"
        end
      end  
    end
