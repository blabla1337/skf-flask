# X-XSS-Protection header
-------

## Example:


    // Ruby on Rails sets encoding header with "utf-8" option by default.
    // If in your case it doesn't or you want to set different encoding, you can do it manually.

    // Add the following code to APP_DIR/config/environments/production.rb
    config.encoding = 'utf-8'
