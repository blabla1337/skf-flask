# Open Forwards and Redirects 
-------

## Example:


    /*
    When using forwards & redirects you should make sure the URL is being explicitly 
    declared in the code and cannot be manipulated by an attacker like:
    */

    //response.Redirect("/login");

    /*
    Generally you should avoid getting input into the redirect which could contain
    user-input by any means. if for any reason this may not be feasible than you 
    should make a WhiteList input validation for the redirect like so:
    */

    package com.edw;

    public class OpenForwards {

        public boolean openForwards(String redirect)
        {
            WhiteList listMe = new WhiteList();
            boolean validated = true;

            //For more information about white-listing see the "WhiteListing" code example:
            if (listMe.WhiteListing("page1,page2,page3", redirect) == false) { validated = false; }

            //return the value back to the servlet in order to handle redirection. 
            //if the variable validate is true then it will redirect
            
            return validated; 
        }  
    }
