# Aggregate User Control 
-------

## Example:


	/*
	In order to enforce Aggregate access control protection the best method would be to 
	define your rules by means of a database structure rather than sessions or logs.

	Verify the system can protect against aggregate or continuous access of secured functions, 
	resources, or data. For example, consider the use of a resource governor to limit the number 
	of edits per hour or to prevent the entire database from being scraped by an individual user.

	TABLE users
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
	| userID | userName | password | privilegeID |    access    |     aggregate	    |
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
	|   1    | Admin    | Csdar323 |      1      |     TRUE     |       2322        |
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
	|   2    | User     | Adf4fsv  |      2      |     FALSE    |         0         |
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
	|   3    | Guest    | dff4fKr  |      3      |     TRUE     |        125        |   
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	TABLE privileges
	----------------------------------   
	| privilegeID | privilege        | 
	----------------------------------
	|     1       | edit:read:delete |
	----------------------------------
	|     2       | edit:read        |
	----------------------------------
	|     3       | read             |
