# XSL injection prevention
-------

## Example:

    
    """
	In order to prevent XSL injections you must enforce strict policy's whenever the
	files are loaded from a source controlled by an possible attacker.

	Let's say for example that the user can choose from several XSL files on your application.

	ABC.xsl arranges your employee names on alphabetical order
	CBA.xsl does not care and just shows the input by order of your XML file.

	Before we want to attach the XSL files to the style sheet we first want to
	do validation on the request to make sure the included file was one of our own pre
	defined files, example:
	including("file1.xsl,file2.xsl,etc", filename)
	"""


	def including(whiteListing, input):

		continue = True

		"""
		First, we want to filter the filenames for expected values. For this example we use only a-z/0-9 and .
		Whenever the values are tampered with, we can assume an attacker is trying to inject malicious input.
		for more information about validation see "input validations" in the code examples:
		"""

		if inputValidation(inputParameter, validationType, "Invalid userinput", "HIGH") == False:
			continue = False

		"""
		We want to whitelist the paged for expected values, in this example they are,
		page1,page2 etc.. for more information about whitelisting see "white-listing" in the code examples:
