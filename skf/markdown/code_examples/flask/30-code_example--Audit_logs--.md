# Audit logs

## Example:


    """
    The log function does not have to be complicated as long as you log at least these 6 values

    Whenever a user is registered or added to your system, the application must also
    automatically generate a table for this user which contains his userID, counter and blocker
    variable in order to keep track of his behavior.
