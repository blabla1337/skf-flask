# Open forwards & redirects
-------

## Example:

    
    """
    When using forwards & redirects you should make sure the URL is being explicitly
    declared in the code and cannot be manipulated by an attacker like example.com?page=dashboard :
    """

    redirect(url_for('dashboard'))

    """
    Generally you should avoid getting input into the redirect which could contain
    user-input by any means. if for any reason this may not be feasible than you
    should make a whitelist input validation for the redirect like so:

    Example : 
    If the whitelisting list is home, upload and redirectParam is home 

    redirectParam = home
    redirecting("home,upload", redirectParam, "3")
    """


    def redirecting(whitelisting, input, count):
        
        """
        We want to whitelist the paged for expected values, in this example they are,
        page1,page2 etc.. for more information about whitelisting see "white-listing" 
        in the code examples:
        """

        if whitelisting(whitelisting, input, count) == True:
            //Redirect the Input if whitelisting is correct
            redirect(url_for(input))
