Secure session cookies
-------

## Example:

    
	/*
	Whenever  a cookie is sent over a secured connection, the cookie should be set
	with the secure flag, in order to guarantee the integrity of the data it contains.

	in the <system.web> element, add the following element:

	<httpCookies requireSSL="true" />

	whenever you have a <forms> element in your system.web block, this setting will 
	override the setting in httpCookies, changing it's value back to false.

	In that case, you need to add the requireSSL="true" attribute to the forms element as well.
	*/
	
	<system.web>
		<authentication mode="Forms">
			<forms requireSSL="true"> <-- secure flag
				/* forms content */
			</forms>
		</authentication>
	</system.web>
	
	
	//Or programmatically
	//C# Code:
	
	HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("AuthToken", guid);
	HttpContext.Current.Response.Cookies.Add(myCookie);
	myCookie.Secure = true;
