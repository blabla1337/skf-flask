Enforce secure password
-------

## Example:

	
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Web;
	using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
	using System.IO;


	namespace MvcApplication1.Controllers
	{
		public class passwordcheck
		{
			public bool checkPassword(string password)
			{
				string error = "";
				bool complete = true;

				/*
				Here we define the minimal expected value's for your password.
				The password must at least contain a Capital letter, a normal letter, a special character
				a number and must be at least 8 characters long
				*/
				string[] pattern = new string[3] { "[0-9]", "[A-Z]", "[a-z]" };

				foreach (string validation in pattern)
				{
					//Now if the regex detects any missing character than we will set complete to false
					Regex regex = new Regex(validation);
					Match match = regex.Match(password);

					if (!match.Success)
					{
						error = "You did not enter a valid password";
						complete = false;
					}
				}

				try
				{
					/*
					Also very important is the fact that you have to take into consideration that
					Password1! is a valid password according to password standards. This however is not the case since
					this password is included in almost every dictionary attack system. So we have to prevent 
					the user from using these weak passwords, this we do by defining these bad passwords in a text 
					file and compare the user's password with the bad passwords defined in the text file.
					*/

					StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(@"C:\Users\Public\xml\test.txt", true);
					String FileText = sr.ReadToEnd().ToString();

					string[] strTemp = FileText.Split(',');

					foreach (string value in strTemp)
					{
						if (value == password)
						{
							error = "Your password was a bad password!";
							complete = false;
						}
					}

					sr.Close();
				}
				catch{
					HttpContext.Current.Response.Write("catching file failed");
					throw;
				}

				//The last step is checking the password length to see if it is 8 characters or bigger
				if (password.Length < 8)
				{
					error = "The password was to short";
					complete = false;
				}

				if (complete == true)
				{
					//Do further operation
					HttpContext.Current.Response.Write("Good job password was ok!");
					return true;
				}else{
