Session hijacking
-------

## Example:


	/*
	As soon as a user logs into your application you must store his session id as wel as his
	IP address along with his userID. This information will be used later on in your application in order to
	identify possible session hijacking.

	TABLE track_sessions
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| TrackID | userID |		   	   SESSION 		            |     Ip address	    | 
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|   1     | 1      | 	79dcd529c0f5e01a9bfb2425c52036c6    |	123.45.67.89	|   
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|   2     | 1      | 	79dcd529c0f5e01a9bfb2425c52036c6    |	123.45.67.81	|
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	In order to prevent session hijacking there are a couple of defense strategies
	which combined are a hardened defense.  
	*/

	/*
	First we implement the strict transport security header, this is in order to prevent
	users from accessing your application over an unprotected connection.
	*/

	//Example of the strict transport security header:
	Response.AppendHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000");


	//If all present and future subdomains will be HTTPS:
	Response.AppendHeader("Strict-Transport-Security" max-age=31536000, "includeSubDomains");

	/*
	Recommended: If the site owner would like their domain to be included in the HSTS preload 
	list maintained by Chrome (and used by Firefox and Safari), then use:
	*/

	Response.AppendHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000", "includeSubDomains" ,"preload");

	/*
	The `preload` flag indicates the site owner's consent to have their domain preloaded. 
	The site owner still needs to then go and submit the domain to the list. the preload list
	enforces the browser to always present your application on HTTPS even on the first time
	the user hits your application
	*/

	/*
	Then we set the httpOnly flag
	(see "HttpOnly" in the code examples for more details about implementation)
	*/
	
	/*
	Then we set the flag for session timeout
	(see "Timeout" in the code examples for more details about implementation)
	*/
	
	/*
	Then we set the session secure flag 
	(see "Secure flag" in the code examples for more details about implementation)
	*/
	
	/*
	On login we also add another cookie with a random value to the application in order to
	prevent an attacker to fixate an ASPSESSION id on your users and hijack their sessions
	(This code example can be found in the "Login functionality" for more detailed information)
	*/
	
	
	/*
	NOTE: On applications that require high level security, there should never be an
	remember me functionality implemented.
	*/


	/*
	Now imagine the scenario after the login of the user (see the "login functionality" in
	the code examples for more details). Whenever the user is logged in, the users ip address 
	and session id are also stored in the database these values are used in order to verify 
	if there are multiple users active on the same session. 
	If so, we can let the user decide to terminate the session and terminate the
	other assigned sessions.
