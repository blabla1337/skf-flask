# Open forwards & redirects
-------

## Example:


   	<?php

	/*
	When using forwards & redirects you should make sure the URL is being explicitly
	declared in the code and cannot be manipulated by an attacker like:
	*/

	header("location:redirectpage.php");

	/*
	Generally you should avoid getting input into the redirect which could contain
	user-input by any means. if for any reason this may not be feasible than you
	should make a whitelist input validation for the redirect like so:
	send("value1,value2,etc", $_GET['redirectParam'], "3")
	*/

	class redirecting{
		public function send($whiteListing, $inputParam, $countLevel){

			//Include the classes of which you want to use objects from
			include_once("classes.php");

			$whitelist = new whitelisting();

			/*
			We want to whitelist the paged for expected values, in this example they are,
			page1,page2 etc.. for more information about whitelisting see "white-listing" in the code examples:
			*/
			if($whitelist->checkpattern($whiteListing, $inputParameter, $countLevel) == true){
				header("location:".$inputParam."");
			}			
		}
	}

    ?>
