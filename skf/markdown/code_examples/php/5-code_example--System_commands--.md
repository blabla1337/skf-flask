# System commands
-------

## Example:


    <?php

	class systemCommands{ 	

		/*
		Define the whitelist pattern and validation type and input parameter like:
		getFiles("value1,value2,etc", "alphanumeric", $_GET['filename'], "3")
		*/
		public function command($whiteListPattern, $validationType, $inputParameter){

			//Here we include al the necessary classes like audit logs, whitelisting and validation:
			include("classes.php");

			$validate  = new validation();
			$whitelist = new whitelisting();

			$continue = true;

			/*
			Whenever a system command is finished, you should properly sanitize and escape this user input.
			System command functions examples are: system(), eval(), exec()

			First, we want to filter the filenames for expected values. For this example we use only a-z/0-9
			Whenever the values are tampered with, we can assume an attacker is trying to inject malicious input.
			for more information about validation see "input validations" in the code examples:
			*/

			if($validate->inputValidation($inputParameter, $validationType,
			"Invalid user input for system commands", "HIGH", $countLevel) == false) {$continue = false;}

			/*
			Second, we want to whitelist the filenames for expected values, in this example they are,
			page1,page2 etc.. for more information about whitelisting see "white-listing" in the code examples:
			*/

			if($whitelist->checkpattern($whiteListPattern, $inputParameter, $countLevel) == false)
			{$continue = false;}

			//If all went good we include the filename
			if($continue == true){

				//Even though there is a match we still escape the shellcommand:
				$command = './configure '.$inputParameter;
				$escaped_command = escapeshellcmd($command);
				//Only after validation do we put the shellcommand into the system() function:
				system($escaped_command);
			}
