# Reflective file download and file download injection prevention

			by identifier based sql query's. As you can see we select the filename
			by its id. in this case we prevent direct user input into the disposition header.

				an uncommon content-type header for it.
				NOTE: These mimetypes should not be stored based upon the mimetype which was send
				the response header when the user uploaded the file. This value can be easily
				manipulated with an intercepting proxy. You should get the mimetype from the file
				itself after it was stored on the server.

		we whitelist them.
