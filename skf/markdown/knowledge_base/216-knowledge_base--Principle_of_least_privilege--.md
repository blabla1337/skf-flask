# Principle of least privilege
-------

## Description:

The application should always be request minimal permissions for required functionality and
resources. This is also known as principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege 
recommends that accounts have the least amount of privilege required to perform their 
business processes. This encompasses user rights, resource permissions such as CPU limits, 
memory, network, and file system permissions. 

Whenever the application is compromised by a potential attacker, the attacker does not gain more arbitrary control over the victim's device

## Solution:

Verify that the application is requesting minimal permissions for required functionality and
resources.
