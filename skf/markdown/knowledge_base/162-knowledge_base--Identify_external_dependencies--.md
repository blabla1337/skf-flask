## Description:

Sometimes your application has certain external dependencies which may strongly
influence your application's operation. These external dependencies
might become an attackers target since compromising that service might lead to
a DoS of your system or influence the system in such a way it leaves room for other
attacks.

## Solution:

First, you must identify which external dependencies your application relays on
for its operation. Second, there should be a fail-safe implemented should this dependency ever
fail to deliver its services towards your application.
