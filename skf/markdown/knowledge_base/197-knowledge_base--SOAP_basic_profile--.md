# SOAP based web services compliant with (WS-I) Basic Profile
-------

## Description:

Simple Soap Binding Profile is a specification from the Web Services Interoperability industry consortium. It
is intended as a support profile for the WS-I Basic Profile. This profile defines the way WSDL
documents are to bind operations to a specific transport protocol SOAP.

## Solution:

Verify that the SOAP based web services are making use of the WS-I Basic profile. To be compliant with this standard, it essentially means the application infrastructure must be TLS protected.
