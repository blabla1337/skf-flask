## Description:

A repudiation attack happens when an application or system does not adopt controls to
properly track and log users actions, thus permitting malicious manipulation or forging
the identification of new actions. This attack can be used to change the authoring
information of actions executed by a malicious user in order to log wrong data to log files.
Its usage can be extended to general data manipulation in the name of others,
in a similar manner as spoofing mail messages. If this attack takes place, the data stored
in log files can be considered invalid or misleading.

## Solution:

This type of data should always be processed out of reach of the user and should be
verified and enforced server-side.
