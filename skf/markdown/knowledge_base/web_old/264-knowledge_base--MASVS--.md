##Description:


The OWASP Mobile App Security and Verification (MASVS) Project provides a basis for testing mobile application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development. It can be used by mobile software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and consistency of test results. 

The requirements were developed with the following objectives in mind:

Use as a metric - Provide developers and application owners with a yardstick with which to assess the degree of trust that can be placed in their mobile applications,
Use as guidance - Provide guidance to security control developers as to what to build into security controls in order to satisfy application security requirements, and
Use during procurement - Provide a basis for specifying application security verification requirements in contracts.
