##Description:

Multiple database of leaked credentials have been released during breaches over the years. If users choose passwords already leaked, they are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

## Solution:

Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login, and password change are checked against a set of breached passwords. In case the password chosen has already been breached, the application must require the user to re-enter a non-breached password.
