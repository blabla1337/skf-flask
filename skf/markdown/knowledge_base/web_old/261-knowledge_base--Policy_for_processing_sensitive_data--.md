##Description: 

Some data on an application can be consider sensitive due to its importance:
- Social security number
- Credit card or banking information
Or by the context of the information:
- Passphrase used as a password of an application
- University restricted or critical data

On applications, data considered sensitive should be kept safe. The way we secure the data could be defined by us, but some information it should be made according to a standard - i.e. all applications that manipulate credit card information should comply with one of the pci standards.


## Solution:

Identify the list of sensitive data that is being processed by the application.

Establish, maintain, and disseminate a security policy for processing and storing sensitive data. If information should be encrypted, separated in another database, etc. If exist, follow the appropriate standard.
