##Description:

Whenever sensitive data is rapidly removed from the systems’ memory, this decreases the possibility the attacker has to compromise this data by means of memory dumping attacks.

## Solution:

Verify that sensitive data is rapidly sanitized from memory as soon as it is no longer needed and handled in accordance with functions and techniques supported by the framework/library/operating system.
