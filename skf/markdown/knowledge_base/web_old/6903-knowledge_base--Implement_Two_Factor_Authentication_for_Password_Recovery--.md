##Description:

To verify the user is who he claims to be in order to recover a forgotten password a two factor authentication mechanism should be implemented.

##Mitigation:

To verify forgotten password, and other recovery paths, use a TOTP (Time Based One Time Password) like google authenticator or other soft token, mobile push, or another offline recovery mechanism.
