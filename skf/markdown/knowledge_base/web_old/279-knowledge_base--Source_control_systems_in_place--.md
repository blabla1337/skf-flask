##Description:

A component of software configuration management, version control, also known
as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents,
computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.
Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number",
"revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files
is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2",
and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the
change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

Benefits of source control for security are amongst others,
- Restoring Previous Versions
- Understanding What Happened
- Backup
- Easy to Review code
- Fundemental for CI/CD integrations

##Mitigation:

Verify that a source code control system is in use, with procedures to
ensure that check-ins are accompanied by issues or change tickets. 
The source code control system should have access control and 
identifiable users to allow traceability of any changes.
