##Description:
When a user is informed of critical operations than the user can determine
if the notification is send by his own actions, or that the notifucation indicates 
potential compromitation of his user account.

##Mitigation:

Verify that secure notifications are sent to users after updates
to authentication details, such as credential resets, email or address changes,
logging in from unknown or risky locations. Users must also be notified when
password policies change or any other important updates that require action from the
user to increase the security of his account.

The use of push notifications - rather than SMS or email - is preferred, but in the 
absence of push notifications, SMS or email is acceptable as long as no sensitive information is disclosed in the notification.
