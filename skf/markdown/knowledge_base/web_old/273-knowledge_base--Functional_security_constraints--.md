##Description:

Functional security constraints help your software developers determine the level of
grants/authorizations the users have over the application. 

## Solution:

Verify that all user stories and features contain functional security constraints, such as 
"As a user, I should be able to view and edit my profile. I should not be able to view or edit anyone else's profile"
