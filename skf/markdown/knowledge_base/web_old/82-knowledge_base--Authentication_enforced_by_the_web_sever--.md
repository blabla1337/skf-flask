##Description:

Authentication should be enforced by the web-server. Whenever these configurations are
not enforced on the server, an attacker could gain access to authorized
pages on your application.

## Solution:

Always make sure your web-server and application are correctly configured to handle authentication. Also the application and webserver should deny access by default should there be an error of any kind.
