##Description:

The Current state of the data or program should be compared to the previous recorded in order to detect changes.
Throughout the development of the application, there must be perpetual checks in place to check if all 
pages and resources by default require authentication except those specifically intended to be public.
Sometimes developers simply forget to implement these checks, or they remove the checks temporarily 
for testing purposes. 

##Mitigation:

Verify all access controls are implemented properly in order to prevent a user access data/functions which 
he was not intended to use.
