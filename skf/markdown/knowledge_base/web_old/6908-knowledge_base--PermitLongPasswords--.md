##Description:

Passwords of at least 64 characters should be allowed. 
The use of password managers should be encouraged and supported by ensuring users can paste into password data entry fields, 
thereby enabling the automated use of password managers. 

##Mitigation:

Verify that passwords of 64 characters or longer are permitted.
