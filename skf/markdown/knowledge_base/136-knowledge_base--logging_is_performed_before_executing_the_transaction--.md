## Description:

Whenever the logging is performed before executing a transaction you can be ensured that
the transactions are logged. This increases the integrity of your log files.
If logging is performed after executing a transaction and an attacker does a succcessful attack, then the logging part may not be reached and no trace would be recorded for the attack.

## Solution:

Verify that logging is performed before executing the transaction. If logging was
unsuccessful (e.g. disk full, insufficient permissions) the application fails safe.
This is for when integrity and non-repudiation is a must.
