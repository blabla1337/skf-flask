## Description:

Whenever you are parsing data exchange formats such as XML, JSON, CSV, etc, you
have to make sure that whenever these data files contain malicious code this will not be
executed by your application. You should also not solely depend on your parser to do all
the encoding and escaping for you since there could always be an edge case that does
execute certain attacks.

## Solution:

We highly recommend doing your own escaping, sanitizing, encoding on all data before entering your application. The risk also depends on the context of wherever you are putting this data into. So before you are doing any mutations with your data after getting it from the resources, make sure you have applied the right mitigations.

Also, another reason to build an extra layer of escaping, sanitizing, encoding routines in your application is for the logging you want to apply on the data.
