## Description:

Throughout the development of the application there must be perpetual checks in place to check
if all pages and resources by default require authentication except those specifically intended to be public.

Sometimes developers simply forget to implement these checks, or they remove the checks 
temporarily for testing purposes. 


## Solution:

Verify all access controls are implemented properly in order to prevent a user access data/functions which 
he was not intended to use.
