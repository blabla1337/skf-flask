## Description:

When adding schema's to your JSON or XML files you have better control over what type of user-input can be supplied in your application. This dramatically decreases an attacker’s vector when implemented the right way. Nonetheless, you should always apply your own input validation and rejection as an extra layer of defense. This approach is also desirable since you also want to do countering and logging on the user’s requests and input.	 

## Solution:

Verify that XML or JSON schema are in place and verified before accepting input.
