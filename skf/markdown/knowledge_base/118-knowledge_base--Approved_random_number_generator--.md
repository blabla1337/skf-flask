## Description:

The lack of entropy available for, or used by, a pseudo-random number generator can be a
stability and security threat.

## Solution:

All random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs, and random must be generated using
the cryptographic module's approved random number generator when these random values are
intended to be unguessable/unpredictable by an attacker.
