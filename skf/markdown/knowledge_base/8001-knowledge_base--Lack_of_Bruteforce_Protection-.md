## Description:

Every password is hackable. Even the stronger ones, as well. The technique name is bruteforce. In case the attacker can do several of thousand login attempts to find out the proper password, then just matter of time and he/she will be successful.

## Solution:

It is recommended to employ different level of controls, like: rate limiting, CAPTCHA, increasing delays, IP address restrictions, locking accounts, risk-based restrictions. Verify that no more than 5-7 failed attempts is possible on a single account.
