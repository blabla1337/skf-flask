## Description:

Character encoding is the process of mapping characters, numbers and other symbols to a
standard format. Typically, this is done to create a message ready for transmission
between sender and receiver. It is, in simple terms, the conversion of characters
(belonging to different languages like English, Chinese, Greek or any other known language)
into bytes. An example of a widely used character encoding scheme is the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) that initially used 7-bit codes.
More recent examples of encoding schemes would be the Unicode UTF-8 and UTF-16 computing
industry standards. In the space of application security and due to the plethora of
encoding schemes available, character encoding has a popular misuse. It is being used for
encoding malicious injection strings in a way that obfuscates them. This can lead to the
bypass of input validation filters, or take advantage of particular ways in which browsers
render encoded text.

## Solution:

When trying to figure out the character encoding of a resource, user agents will try, in
this order:

- The HTTP Content-Type header sent by the server
- The XML declaration (only for XHTML documents)
- HTML/XHTML meta element.

Make sure this information is provided by your application for the server in order to
prevent it from guessing the wrong encoding standard, leaving room for injection.

## Note:

These three ways of providing the character encoding of a document are not
equivalent.
