## Description:

This header enables the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into most recent
web browsers. It is usually enabled by default anyway, so the role of this header is to re-enable the filter for this particular website if it was disabled by the user. This header is supported in IE 8 and in Chrome 4.

## Solution:

These headers are also known as the: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block and provide protection against XSS attacks when implemented in the application or web-server.

##NOTE:
This header only protects against some reflected XSS attacks. This is no substitute for normal escaping and input filtering and sanitization.
