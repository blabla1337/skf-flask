## Description:

Whenever structured data is strongly typed and validated against a defined schema the application
can be developed as a defensible pro-active application. The application can now measure everything
that is outside of its intending operation by means of the defined schema's and should be used to
reject the input if the schema checks return false.


## Solution:

Verify that structured data is strongly typed and validated against a defined schema
including allowed characters, length and pattern (e.g. credit card numbers or telephone, 
or validating that two related fields are reasonable, such as validating suburbs and zip or 
post codes match
