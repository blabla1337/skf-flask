## Description:

Verify the system can protect against aggregation or continuous access to functions,  
resources, or data. For example, possibly by the use of a resource governor to limit the
number of edits per minute in order to to prevent an automatic attack

## Solution:

Verify the application has the ability to detect and alert on abnormal numbers of requests
for information or processing high-value transactions for that user role, automated use of web service extraction, or data loss prevention. For example, the average user should not be able to access more than 5 records per hour or 30 records
per day or add 10 friends to a social network per minute.
