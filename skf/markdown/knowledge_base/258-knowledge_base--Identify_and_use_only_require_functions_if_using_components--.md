## Description:

Applications have many different components that are needed for the business functions 
or for the security functions they provide. With many different components, there are
also possible vulnerabilities that can arise. Also, most of the components functions 
that are delivered are not necessary needed and can introduce a vulnerability in a specific part
that may not be even used by the application. Also, these security issues in the components 
are publicly well know and documented. 

## Solution:

The best approach in minimizing the possible security issues that can arise in application 
components and identify the required functions and disable or remove those that are not
needed by the application business functions or security functions. This way there is a lower risk
when using those components and easier to maintain and protecting the application.
