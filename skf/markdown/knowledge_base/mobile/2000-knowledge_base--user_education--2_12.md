## Description:

User Education

MSTG-STORAGE-12: The app educates the user about the types of personally identifiable information processed, as well as security best practices the user should follow in using the app.

A lot has happened lately in terms of responsibilities that developers have to educate users on what they need to know.

This has shifted especially with the introduction of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/ "GDPR") in Europe. Ever since then, it is best to educate users on what is happening with their private data and why.


## Mitigation:

It is a good practice to inform the user about how to use the application properly. This should ensure a secure handling and processing of the user's information.

A user should be informed on what type of device data the app will access, whether that is PII or not.

You need to share Open Source Software (OSS) related information with the user.
