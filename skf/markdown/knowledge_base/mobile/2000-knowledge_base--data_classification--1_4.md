## Description:

Data Classification

MSTG-ARCH-4: Data considered sensitive in the context of the mobile app is clearly identified.

It's critical to classify data in your system and determine which level of sensitivity each piece of data belongs to. Each data category can then be mapped to protection rules necessary for each level of sensitivity. For example, public marketing information that is not sensitive may be categorized as public data which is ok to place on the public website. Credit card numbers may be classified as private user data which may need to be encrypted while stored or in transit.


## Mitigation:

Classify and assigning level of sensitivity to data when created, modified, deleted or
serialized and define confidentiality, integrity and availability rates.
