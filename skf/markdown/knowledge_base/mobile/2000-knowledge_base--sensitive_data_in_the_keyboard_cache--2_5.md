## Description:

Sensitive Data in the Keyboard Cache

MSTG-STORAGE-5: The keyboard cache is disabled on text inputs that process sensitive data.

Several options for simplifying keyboard input are available to users. These options include autocorrection and spell checking. When users type in input fields, the software automatically suggests data. This feature can be very useful for messaging apps. However, the keyboard cache may disclose sensitive information when the user selects an input field that takes this type of information.


## Mitigation:

Make sure third party keyboards are disabled when user processes sensitive data
