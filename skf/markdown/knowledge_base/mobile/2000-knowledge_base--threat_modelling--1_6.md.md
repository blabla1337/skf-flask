## Description:

Threat modelling

MSTG-ARCH-6: A threat model for the mobile app and the associated remote services has been produced that identifies potential threats and countermeasures.

Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value.

A threat model is a structured representation of all the information that affects the security of an application. In essence, it is a view of the application and its environment through the lens of security.

Threat modeling can be applied to a wide range of things, including software, applications, systems, networks, distributed systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and business processes.

A threat model typically includes:
	- Description of the subject to be modeled
	- Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
	- Potential threats to the system
	- Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat
	- A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken

Threat modeling is a process for capturing, organizing, and analyzing all of this information. Applied to software, it enables informed decision-making about application security risks. In addition to producing a model, typical threat modeling efforts also produce a prioritized list of security improvements to the concept, requirements, design, or implementation of an application.


## Mitigation:

The threat modeling process can be decomposed into three high level steps. Each step is documented as it is carried out. The resulting document is the threat model for the application.
	Step 1: Decompose the Application
	Step 2: Determine and Rank Threats
	Step 3: Determine Countermeasures and Mitigation
