## Description:

Checking for Weaknesses in Third Party Libraries

MSTG-CODE-5: All third party components used by the mobile app, such as libraries and frameworks, are identified, and checked for known vulnerabilities.

Applications often make use of third party libraries which accelerate development as the developer has to write less code in order to solve a problem. However, third party libraries may contain vulnerabilities, incompatible licensing, or malicious content. Additionally, it is difficult for organizations and developers to manage application dependencies, including monitoring library releases and applying available security patches.


## Mitigation:

Ensure that the libraries used by the apps are not carrying vulnerabilities.
