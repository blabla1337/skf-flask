## Description:

Determining Whether the App is Debuggable

MSTG-CODE-2: The app has been built in release mode, with settings appropriate for a release build (e.g. non-debuggable).

While debugging is a useful feature when developing an app, it has to be turned off before releasing apps to application store or within an enterprise program.


## Mitigation:

A release build should generally not contain any debugging symbols.
