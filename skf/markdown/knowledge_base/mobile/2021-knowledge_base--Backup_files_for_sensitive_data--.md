## Description:

Backup files for Sensitive Data

MSTG-STORAGE-8: No sensitive data is included in backups generated by the mobile operating system.

Since backing up installed apps and their data, an obvious concern is whether sensitive user data stored by the app might unintentionally leak through the backup file. Another concern, though less obvious, is whether sensitive configuration settings used to protect data or restrict app functionality could be tampered to change app behavior after restoring a modified backup. Both concerns are valid and these vulnerabilities have proven to exist in a vast number of apps today.


## Mitigation:

Backup files should not store any sensitive application specific data and they should be analysed/inspected for that.
