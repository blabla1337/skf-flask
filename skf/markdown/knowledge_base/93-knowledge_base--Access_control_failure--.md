## Description:

Handling errors securely is a key aspect of secure coding. There are two types of errors
that deserve special attention. The first is exceptions that occur in the processing of a
security control itself. It is important that these exceptions do not enable behavior
that the countermeasures would normally not allow. As a developer, you should consider
that there are generally three possible outcomes from a security
mechanism: 

- allow the operation
- disallow the operation
- exception 

in general you should design your security mechanism so that a failure will follow the same
execution path as disallowing the operation.

## Solution:

Security methods like isAuthorized(), isAuthenticated(), and validate() should all return
false if there is an exception during processing.
If security controls can throw exceptions, they must be very clear about exactly what that
condition means.
