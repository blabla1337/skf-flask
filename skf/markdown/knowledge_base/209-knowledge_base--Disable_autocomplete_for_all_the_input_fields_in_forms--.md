## Description:

Browser autocomplete and password managers could be used by attackers to steal sensitive
information. Whenever an application is susceptible to XSS (Cross site scripting) attacks,
the attacker can inject forms into the application which are autocompleted by the browser.

The attacker can then use JavaScript to read the input fields and steal credentials or
other sensitive information.

## Solution:

The browser should explicitly be told for all the input fields that the autocomplete function
should be turned off. The "autocomplete=off" HTML attribute should be added to all the input and
hidden input fields in the form you want to disable the autocomplete of.
