## Description:

An application could implement authentication functionalities through JavaScript and HTML.
However, these are client-side constraints that are imposed, which means that a hacker
can easily disable or modify these constraints.

## Solution:

Never implement client-side authentication constraints, since these are easily bypassed.
When implementing authentication methods always use server-side solutions.
