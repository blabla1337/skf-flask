## Description:

Whenever the users username and passwords are disclosed by an application on what ever fashion possible, the 
users account should still be proteced by two factor authentication mechanisms to prevent attackers
from logging in with the credentials.


## Solution:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism â€“ typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are)

Examples of two/multi factor authentication can be 

1. Google authenticator
   Google Authenticator is an application that implements two-step verification services using the Time-based 
   One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) and HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm 

2. Yubikey

  The YubiKey is a hardware authentication device manufactured by Yubico that supports one-time passwords, public key   
  encryption and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol[1] developed by the FIDO Alliance (FIDO U2F).
  It allows users to securely log into their accounts by emitting one-time passwords or using a FIDO-based public/private
  key pair generated by the device
