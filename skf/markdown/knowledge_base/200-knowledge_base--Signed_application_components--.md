## Description:

When an application don't use signed components an attacker can easily modify parts
of the application and load inject a backdoors. Also the attacker could
modify business logic in the application without notice. Signed application
components can help harden your application and make it noticeable when an attacker tries to
modify the code.

## Solution:

Create for the different components in the application signed signatures and verify these in
the application at starting of the application and at run-time level.
