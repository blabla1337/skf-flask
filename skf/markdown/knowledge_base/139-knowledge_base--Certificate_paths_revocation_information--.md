## Description:

Whenever your certificate authority is not trusted anymore you should always be able to
recall these certificates ASAP to prevent man in the middle attacks on your applications users.

## Solution:

The trust anchor for given zone is found in the keyset-<zone name> file on the secure
signing computer in the same location where the signed and unsigned copies of the zone reside.
This file is created automatically as part of the signing process.
A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list, created and signed by a
certificate authority (CA), which contains serial numbers of certificates that have been
issued by that CA and are currently revoked. In addition to the serial number of the
revoked certifications, the CRL also contains the reason for revocation for each certificate
and the time the certificate was revoked. The serial number for each revoked certificate is
kept in the CAs database and published in the CRL until the certificate expires.

After the revoked certificate is expired, the certificates entry in the CRL is removed and
the CA may remove the certificate from its database. Typically, the revoked certificate
will remain in the CRL for one publication period after the certificate expires. By all
times you should have this information in reach in order to take quick actions.
