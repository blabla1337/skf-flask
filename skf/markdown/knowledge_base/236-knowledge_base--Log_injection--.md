## Description:

Log injection problems are a subset of injection problem, in which invalid entries taken
from user input are inserted in logs or audit trails, allowing an attacker to mislead
administrators or cover traces of an attack. Log injection can also sometimes be used to
attack log monitoring systems indirectly by injecting data that monitoring systems will
misinterpret.


## Solution:

You should consider these three controls when implementing logging systems.

- Design: If at all possible, avoid logging data that came from external inputs.

- Implementation: Ensure that all log entries are statically created, or if they must
  record external data that the input is vigorously white-list checked.

- Run time: Avoid viewing logs with tools that may interpret control characters in the
  file, such as command-line shells.

Also verify that all non-printable symbols and field separators are properly encoded in log entries,
to prevent log injection.
