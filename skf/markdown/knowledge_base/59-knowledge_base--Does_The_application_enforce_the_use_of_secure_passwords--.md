## Description:

Applications should encourage the use of strong passwords and pass-phrases. Preferably the
password policy should not put limitations or restrictions on the chosen passwords for example
the length of a passowrd or pass-phrase. Whenever the application supports strong passwords and
the use of password managers, the possibility for an attacker performing a succesfull brute-force 
attack drops significantly.

This also increases the possibility that the application can be used with users' passwords managers.

## Solution:

Verify password entry fields allow, or encourage, the use of passphrases, and do not prevent
password managers, long passphrases or highly complex passwords being entered.
