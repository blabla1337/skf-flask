## Description:

The encryption techniques used in the application must be known and proven methods.
When there is a self-made hashing algorithm developed, it is likely to contain
vulnerabilities due to math-flaws resulting in encryption which can be broken.

## Solution:

Never implement your own designed Crypto functions.
Verify that cryptographic modules used by the application have been validated against
FIPS 140-2 or an equivalent standard.
