## Description:

All sessions should implement an idle or inactivity timeout.
This timeout defines the amount of time a session will remain active in case there is no
activity in the session, closing and invalidating the session upon the defined idle period
since the last HTTP request received by the web application for a given session ID.
The idle timeout limits the chances an attacker has to guess and use a valid session ID
from another user. However, if the attacker is able to hijack a given session,
the idle timeout does not limit the attacker's actions, as he can generate activity on
the session periodically to keep the session active for longer periods of time.

Session timeout management and expiration must be enforced on the server-side. If the client is
used to enforce the session timeout, for example using the session token or other client
parameters to track time references (e.g. number of minutes since login time), an attacker
could manipulate these to extend the session duration.

## Solution:

All user sessions should time-out based on logic server-side in order to decrease an
attackers attack vector on the user session.
