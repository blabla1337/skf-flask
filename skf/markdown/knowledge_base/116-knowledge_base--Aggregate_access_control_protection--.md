## Description:

Verify the system can protect against aggregation or continuous access of
secured functions, resources, or data. For example, possibly by the use of a
resource governor to limit the number of edits per hour or to prevent the entire database
from being scraped by an individual user.

## Solution:

The system should contain a counter which can keep up with the number of times a certain
users addresses database tables and should be rejected when he passes a reasonable number.
This violation should also be reported since it could indicate an attacker scraping your
table contents and stealing company information.
