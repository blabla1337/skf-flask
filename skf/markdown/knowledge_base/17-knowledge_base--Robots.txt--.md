## Description:

Each site uses a robots.txt file which allows search engines to provide information.
The robots.txt determines what pages may or may not be indexed by google or yahoo etc.
However, a common mistake made by programmers is applying a blacklisting method causing
the application displaying sensitive information to attackers.

## Solution:

Instead of the blacklisting method:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /squirrelmail/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /modules/

You should use a whitelisting method:

User-agent: *
Disallow: *
Allow: /index.html
Allow: /home.html
