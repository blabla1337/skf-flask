## Description:

Whenever user generated session IDs are not rejected by the server,
an attacker could change the session credentials given by the server on the targets
computer into an easy to remember value.

The attacker then changes his own session credentials with the easily to remember
value he used on the target's computer. Through this,  the attacker could do a session hijacking
on the targets current session.

## Solution:

All session IDs not generated by the server should be rejected.
