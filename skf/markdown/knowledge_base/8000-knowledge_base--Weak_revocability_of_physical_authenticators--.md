## Description:

The physical authenticators are very powerful and have some advantages, still they must be considered as compromised, if they were stolen or disappeared. In this case the user (owner of the physical token) needs to get these tokens revoked. 
If the revocation process it not effective, then the attacker could use it on behalf of the owner and could get access to their resources.

## Solution:

Ensure that revocation is immediately effective across all Identity Providers and Relying Parties.
