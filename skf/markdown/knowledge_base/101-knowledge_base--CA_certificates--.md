## Description:

In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that
issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key
by the named subject of the certificate. Sometimes it happens that a CA goes bad and is
revoked from the browser. This will lead to untrusted TLS connections if your application
uses an issued certificate from this CA.

## Solution:

It's always a good idea to let multiple CA you trust create a certificate, the best way is that you create yourself the key pair (pub & priv) and let the CA sign it. This way you don't need to 'leak' your priv key and you have backup trusted certificates you can use as a backup when one goes 'bad'.
