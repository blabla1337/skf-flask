##Description:

Users should be able to update their password whenever it is necessary. For example, take in consideration the scenario in which they tend to use the same password for multiple purposes. If this password is leaked, the users have to immediately update their credentials in every application they are registered. Therefore, if the application does not provide an accessible password update functionality to a user, there is the risk that his account may be taken over.

##Solution:

Applications should provide to the user a functionality that permits the change of its own password.
