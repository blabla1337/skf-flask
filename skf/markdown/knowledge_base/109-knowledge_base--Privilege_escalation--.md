## Description:

In every portion of the application where a user can create information in the database (e.g., making a payment, adding a contact, or sending a message), then he can receive information (statement of account, order details, etc.), or delete information (drop users, messages, etc.), it is necessary to record that functionality. The tester should try to access such functions as another user in order to verify if it is possible to access a function that should not be permitted by the users role/privilege (but might be permitted as another user).

## Solution:

Checking if a user has enough authorization to execute certain request should always be enforced on the server-side. Also, you may apply the Principle of Least privilege, the principle of least privilege recommends that accounts have the least amount of privilege required to perform their business processes. This encompasses user rights, resource permissions such as CPU limits, memory, network, and file system permissions. For example, if a user only requires access to the network, read access to a database table, and the ability to write to a log, this describes all the permissions that should be granted. Under no circumstances should the user be granted administrative privileges. Also for making testing easier, you can create Unit-tests that verifies the user role permissions.
