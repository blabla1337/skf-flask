## Description:

The ability to restrict and maintain user actions within unique sessions is critical to
web security. Most users of this guide will be using an application framework with built
in session management capabilities. Others will use languages such as Perl CGI that do not.
Those without a built in session management system and those who override the existing
session management systems are at an immediate disadvantage. Implementations built from
scratch are often weak and breakable. Developers are strongly discouraged from
implementing their own Session Management.

## Solution:

Always use the frameworks default session management control implementation in your application. 
If not possible you should find hardened guides in how to accomplish this in a secure manner.
