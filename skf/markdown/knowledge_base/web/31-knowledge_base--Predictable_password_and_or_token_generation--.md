## Description:

Tokens or passwords that are used within the application must contain high entropy in
order to prevent the prediction of these values.

## Solution:

Tokens should contain a high level entropy and randomness to prevent predictable token generation.
All random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs, and random must be generated using
the cryptographic module's approved random number generator
when these random values are intended to be unguessable by an attacker.
