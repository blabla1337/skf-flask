## Description:

To ensure that the application is robust against all forms of input data, this data should
be sanitized and/or encoded on server-side since an attacker could otherwise easy bypass
these checks with an intercepting proxy.

## Solution:

All input validation and encoding-routines should be implemented on the server-side
outside the reach of an attacker. Just as with the input rejection you should make sure that
after validating the user-input, whenever the input is bad it actually rejects, sanitizes
or formats your user-input into not malicious data.

The recommended method for validating user input would be the positive validation method.
Whitelist input validation means allowing only input that is explicitly defined as valid,
as opposed to black-list input validation, which filters out known bad input.

You must also keep track of the users movements by adding an audit trail as well as a
counter for tracking the number of his violations(submitting bad input) in your input
validation class. You should enforce a lockout whenever a unreasonable number of
violations are detected by your application in order to protect it from attackers.
