## Description:

When an attacker obtains a users session cookie, then he can steal the identity of the
user which the session cookie belongs to.

## Solution:

As soon as a session is set for an authenticated user,
the server should keep track of the IP address in which the user used when he started the session.
When the server discovers a change in IP address, for instance when an attacker hijacks an
users session. The server then should deny access, destroy the session and redirect the
'hijacker' to the login page.
