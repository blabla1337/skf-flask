## Description:

The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security.

Confidentiality
In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information
is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes." 
While similar to "privacy," the two words aren't interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality 
is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers.
Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, 
password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.

Integrity
In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy
and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot
be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as
referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a special case of
consistency as understood in the classic ACID model of transaction processing.
Information security systems typically provide message integrity along side to confidentiality.

Availability
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed.
This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, 
the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to
access it must be functioning correctly. High availability systems aim to remain available
at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, 
and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attacks, 
such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.


## Solution:

Based on CIA determine a protection level and define countermessures that belong to that specific 
protection level such as but not limited to.

- encryption requirements
- integrity requirements 
- retention
- privacy 

and other confidentiality requirements, and that these are applied in the architecture.
