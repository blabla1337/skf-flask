## Description:

A vulnerability occurs when an XSL file is loaded from a source controlled by an attacker.
When the attacker is given the opportunity to specify the source of the included XSL file
he could include a file which contains malicious code to be parsed on the target application.
This could lead to, code execution, reading arbitrary files and many more
vulnerabilities such as XSS.

## Solution:

To protect against such vulnerability one needs to make sure that he does not use
user-supplied input in the XSL filename.
The best solution would be to define a list of permitted filenames and
only accept XSL filenames from that list.
