## Description:

The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

A weak encryption scheme can be subjected to brute force attacks that have a reasonable chance of succeeding using current attack methods and resources.

## Mitigation:


PHASE:Architecture and Design:
Use an encryption scheme that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field.
