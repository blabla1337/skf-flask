## Description:

Placing a logout link on every page that requires authentication helps the user end the
session when he is done with the site. Ending the session helps prevent hijacking.

## Solution:

Identify all pages that use authentication. Make a list of all pages on your site that use
authentication then verify the presence of logout links. Examine each page that uses
authentication to make sure it has a logout link in a location that can be
found intuitively.
