## Description:

A named-callable or method control element has a signature that supports a variable (variadic) number of parameters or arguments.

This issue can prevent the software from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability. With variadic arguments, it can be difficult or inefficient for manual analysis to be certain of which function/method is being invoked.

## Mitigation:
