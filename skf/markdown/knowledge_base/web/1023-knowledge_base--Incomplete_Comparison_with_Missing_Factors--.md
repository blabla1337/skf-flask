## Description:

The software performs a comparison between entities that must consider multiple factors or characteristics of each entity, but the comparison does not include one or more of these factors.

An incomplete comparison can lead to resultant weaknesses, e.g., by operating on the wrong object or making a security decision without considering a required factor.

## Mitigation:


PHASE:Testing:
Thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code into production. Perform positive testing as well as negative testing.
