## Description:

When the logout functionality does not revoke the complete session, an attacker could still
impersonate a user when he has access to the session cookie even after the user is logged off the application.

## Solution:

The logout functionality should revoke the complete session whenever a user
wants to terminate his session.

Each different framework has its own guide to achieve this revocation.
It is also recommended for you to make test cases which you follow to ensure
session revocation in your application.
