## Description:

Always use checksums when working with interpreted code, libraries, executables,
and configuration files, when these checksums do not match you can determine that
these files are corrupted or backdoor-ed.

## Solution:

Verify that the integrity of interpreted code, libraries, executables, and configuration
files is verified using checksums or hashes (not MD5).
