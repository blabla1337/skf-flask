## Description:

In authentication, out-of-band refers to utilizing two separate networks or channels, one of which being different from the primary network or channel, simultaneously used to communicate between two parties or devices for identifying a user. A cellular network is commonly used for out-of-band authentication. An example of out-of-band authentication is when an online banking user is accessing their online bank account with a login and a one time password is sent to their mobile phone via SMS to identify them. The primary channel would be the online login screen where the user enters their login information and the second separate channel would be the cellular network. This added layer of security prevents the likelihood of hackers and malware from compromising access to the complete authentication process.


## Solution:

The most effective solution to eliminate the use of mediums such as unencrypted e-mails or VOIP and switch to more secure channels or implement mechanisms like mutual TLS authentication between the interacting parties where possible.
