## Description:

Developers creating HTML5 applications can create fully offline-aware applications using
the HTML5 ApplicationCache interface. The Application Cache uses a cache manifest file to
specify which files in an HTML5 application can be used offline, and which files require a
network connection.

## Solution:

Never store sensitive information in a client side cache since this can be easily
compromised by attackers. The same principle does also apply to autocomplete functions.

Recommended knowledge base item:

- Caching headers
- Client side storage
