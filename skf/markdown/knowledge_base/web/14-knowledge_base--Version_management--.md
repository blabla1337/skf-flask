## Description:

Whenever a programmer decides to use third party software,
he should keep an eye implementing a proper version management methodology for this software.
When hackers discover vulnerabilities they often publish these exploits online in order
to push the developers of this software to fix their issues. As a result,
when your software is not upgraded to the latest available version,
script kiddies could easily compromise your application by following the
exploit tutorials online, thus compromising your application.

## Solution:

One option is not to use components that you did not write.
But that is not very realistic.

Most component projects do not create vulnerability patches for old versions.
Instead, most simply fix the problem in the next version. So upgrading to these new
versions is critical.
Software projects should have a process in place to:

-Identify all components and the versions you are using, including all dependencies.
(e.g., the versions plugin).

-Monitor the security of these components in public databases,
project mailing lists, and security mailing lists, and keep them up to date.

-Establish security policies governing components use, such as requiring certain software
development practices, passing security tests, and acceptable licenses.

-Where appropriate, consider adding security wrappers around components to disable unused
functionality and/ or secure weak or vulnerable aspects of the component.

This also goes for all other components that should be up to date with proper security
configuration(s) and version(s) such as server OS etc.

This should include removal of unneeded configurations and folders such as sample
applications, platform documentation, and default or example users.
