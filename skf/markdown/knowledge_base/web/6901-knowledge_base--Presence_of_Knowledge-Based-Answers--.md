## Description:

Avoid the use of knowledge-based-answers(so-called "secret questions").
Due to the predominant use of social media, the power of Internet search engines, and access to public records via the Internet, your personal information is only be a few keystrokes away, 
allowing an attacker to reset your password or recover sensitive information.

## Solution:

As an alternative use verification by phone where the user has to send you the unique key he has received or 
implement the use of a one time password service like google authenticator.
