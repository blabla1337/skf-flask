## Description:

Whenever session IDs are not generated with a sufficient entropy this could lead to a
session collision or session hijacking. If an attacker can guess an authenticated user's
session identifier, he can take over the user's session.

## Solution:

The WebLogic deployment descriptor should specify a session identifier length of at
least 128 bits. A shorter session identifier leaves the application open to
brute-force session guessing attacks.
