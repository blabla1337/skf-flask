## Description:
Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually 
executing programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is analysis performed on programs 
while they are executing.[1] In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code, 
and in the other cases, some form of the object code.

The term is usually applied to the analysis performed by an automated tool, with human analysis being 
called program understanding, program comprehension, or code review. Software inspections and software 
walkthroughs are also used in the latter case.

## Solution:
There are a lot of different static code analysis tools on the market, it is important to determine
what tools are able to scan your code base. After having selectecd the right SAST tool we can start writing 
custom rules that help identify security risks such as time functions, unsafe file operations and network connections.
