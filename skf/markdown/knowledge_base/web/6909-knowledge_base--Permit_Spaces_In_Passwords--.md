## Description:

	By allowing spaces in passwords, a password can become a passphrase which is almost impossible to crack as long as it is not a common or popular quote.
	Also adding spaces in a password increases the entropy of your password.

## Solution:
	
	Verify that passwords can contain spaces and truncation is not performed. Consecutive multiple spaces MAY optionally be coalesced.
