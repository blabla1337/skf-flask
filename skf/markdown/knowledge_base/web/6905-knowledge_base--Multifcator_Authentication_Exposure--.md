## Description:

Once a multi-factore authentication factor is lost, damaged, or not working, it is important that identity proofing and binding is performed at the same level as during enrollment.

## Solution:

Implement a sign in using alternative methods of authentication like verifying the identity using the email and 
phone that are registered with the user's account. 
Once replaced, the verifier MAY use a single factor to re-bind the account to the new factor.
