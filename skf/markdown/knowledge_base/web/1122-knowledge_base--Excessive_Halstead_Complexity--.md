## Description:

The code is structured in a way that a Halstead complexity measure exceeds a desirable maximum.

A variety of Halstead complexity measures exist, such as program vocabulary size or volume. This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the software, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation:
