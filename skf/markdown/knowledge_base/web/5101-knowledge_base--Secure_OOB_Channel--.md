##Description:

The essential idea behind out-of-band authentication is that by using two different channels, authentication systems can guard against fraudulent users that may only have access to one of these channels. One of the most common examples of out-of-band authentication is in banking transactions. Typically, a customer wishing to do an online bank transaction will be sent an SMS message by cell phone with a password. This way, any hackers or identity thieves that have access through key loggers or other equipment will not be able to access that particular password, because it is sent over a 3G or 4G wireless network instead of being sent over the Internet.It is worthy to ensure the channel between the communicating parties is through a trusted and secure channel.


##Mitigation:

The most effective solution is to switch to a more secure channel and implement mechanisms like mutual TLS between the interacting parties where possible.
