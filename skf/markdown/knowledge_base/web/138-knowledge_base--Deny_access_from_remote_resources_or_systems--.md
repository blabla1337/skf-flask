## Description:

You should always fend off remote connections with untrusted systems/resources which try to
connect to your application in order to prevent connecting to malicious systems that try
to attack your application.

## Solution:

Since this is very difficult to achieve on application level we recommend implementing
EGRESS firewall rules.
