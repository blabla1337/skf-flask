##Description:

cover in order to harden your applications security.

STRIDE stands for:

Tampering

##Mitigation:

The STRIDE was initially created as part of the process of threat modelling. STRIDE is a model of threats, used to help reason and find threats to a system. It is used in conjunction with a model of the target system that can be constructed in parallel. This includes a full breakdown of processes, data stores, data flows and trust boundaries.

Today it is often used by security experts to help answer the question "what can go wrong in this system we're working on?"
