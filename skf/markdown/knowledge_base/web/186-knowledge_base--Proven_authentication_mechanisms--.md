## Description:

Whenever your application has the option for users to authenticate themselves
your method should be "proven" and secure in the sense of that:

1. it should comply to some security standards/guidelines
2. Before implementing authentication on a live environment it has to be pentested/audited by
   professionals.

## Solution:

Verify authentication mechanisms in the application are proven and verified against
ASVS.
