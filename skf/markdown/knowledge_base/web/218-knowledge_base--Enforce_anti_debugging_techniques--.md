## Description:

An attacker can use debug tooling to find out how the application is working and determain the 
possible attack surface by using tooling like GDB or running the application in an emulator. 
Using these type of tooling the attacker can learn a lot about the tool and succesfully attack
the application and have a higher change of succeeding.

## Solution:

The application has to make use of anti-debugging techniques that are sufficient enough to 
deter or delay likely attackers from injecting debuggers into the application. Also the 
application has to be able to notice if it's runned on an emulator or a specially designed 
hardware device that was not intended to be used and to prevent the attacker from gaining 
knowledge about the application.
