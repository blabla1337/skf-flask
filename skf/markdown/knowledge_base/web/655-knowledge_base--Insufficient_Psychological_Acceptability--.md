## Description:

The software has a protection mechanism that is too difficult or inconvenient to use, encouraging non-malicious users to disable or bypass the mechanism, whether by accident or on purpose.



## Mitigation:


PHASE:Testing:
Where possible, perform human factors and usability studies to identify where your product's security mechanisms are difficult to use, and why.

PHASE:Architecture and Design:
Make the security mechanism as seamless as possible, while also providing the user with sufficient details when a security decision produces unexpected results.
