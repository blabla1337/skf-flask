## Description:

Whenever the user is presented a summary of all concurrent sessions, this decreases a potentially
succesful hijacking attack since the user can now see all sessions and terminate one whenever
it does not feel trusted.

## Solution:

The user should be presented with all concurrent and active sessions in his profile/account 
summary. This way the user can keep track of what is happening and can choose to terminate a 
session whenever it feels untrusted. 

Whenever the user shared permission to other applications by means of for example OAuth,
than the user should also be presented that have shared permissions along with the type of permissions 
and activation date.
