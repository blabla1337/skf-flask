## Description:

The application has a validator form that either does not define a validate() method, or defines a validate() method but does not call super.validate().

If you do not call super.validate(), the Validation Framework cannot check the contents of the form against a validation form. In other words, the validation framework will be disabled for the given form.

## Mitigation:


PHASE:Implementation:
Implement the validate() method and call super.validate() within that method.
