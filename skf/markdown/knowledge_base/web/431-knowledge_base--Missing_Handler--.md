## Description:

A handler is not available or implemented.

When an exception is thrown and not caught, the process has given up an opportunity to decide if a given failure or event is worth a change in execution.

## Mitigation:


PHASE:Implementation:
Handle all possible situations (e.g. error condition).

PHASE:Implementation:
If an operation can throw an Exception, implement a handler for that specific exception.
