## Description:

Applications should encourage the use of strong passwords and pass-phrases. Preferably the
password policy should not put limitations or restrictions on the chosen passwords.
Whenever the application supports strong passwords and the use of password managers, the
possibility for an attacker performing a succesfull brute-force attack drops significally.

This also increases the possibility that the application can be used with users' passwords managers.

## Solution:

Verify password entry fields allow, or encourage, the use of passphrases, and do not prevent
password managers, long passphrases or highly complex passwords being entered.
