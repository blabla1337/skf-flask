## Description:

When there is no policy for managing your cryptographic keys, expired or revoked keys
that could unknowingly be used again thus becoming a threat for your encrypted data.

## Solution:

Verify that there is an explicit policy for how cryptographic keys are managed
(e.g., generated, distributed, revoked, expired). Verify that this policy is properly
enforced.
