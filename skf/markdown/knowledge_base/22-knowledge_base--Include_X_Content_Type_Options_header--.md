## Description:

The only defined value, nosniff, prevents Internet Explorer and Google Chrome from
MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.
This also applies to Google Chrome, when downloading extensions.
This reduces exposure to drive-by download attacks and sites serving user uploaded
content that, by clever naming, could be treated by MSIE as executable or dynamic HTML
files.

## Solution:

These headers are also known as the: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff;
and provide protection against Mime content type attacks when implemented in the
application or webserver.
