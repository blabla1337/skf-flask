## Description:

Access to any master secret must be protected from unauthorized access in order to protect
the integrity and the confidentiality of the data.

## Solution:

Whenever sensitive data is stored on the server you should consider storing this data in a separate folder with permission rules in order to prevent unauthorized users from reading these files. It is also highly recommended to encrypt/hash the password in order to enforce higher security.
