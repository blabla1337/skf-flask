## Description:

Whenever default or predictable accounts are available on an application/server this could
lead to an attacker compromising these services. Make sure all default and predictable
accounts are disabled or deleted from the services.

## Solution:

Verify that all keys and passwords are replaceable, and are generated or
replaced after installation time.
