## Description:

The application should always provide a logout functionality (triggerable by a visible button in the UI) to allow users to explicitly terminate their session.

## Solution:

The application has to provide a way to manage all active sessions (like the ones established from different devices or browsers) so that users can either selectively or completely log out all of their active sessions.
