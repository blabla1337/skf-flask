## Description:

STRIDE is a collective for a series of vulnerabilities your applications should
cover in order to harden your applications security.

STRIDE stands for:
Spoofing
Tampering
Repudiation
Information Disclosure
Elevation of privilege

## Solution:

The STRIDE was initially created as part of the process of threat modelling. STRIDE is a model of threats, used to help reason and find threats to a system. It is used in conjunction with a model of the target system that can be constructed in parallel. This includes a full breakdown of processes, data stores, data flows and trust boundaries.

Today it is often used by security experts to help answer the question "what can go wrong in this system we're working on?"
