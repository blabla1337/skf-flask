## Description:

In case of web applications using only biometric authenticators, or using them at first place is not a security best practice.
Asking and validating a data (like passwords) needs to be the first layer of the authentication part, and then the second place the biometric authenticators can be employed.  

## Solution:

Verify that biometric authenticators are limited to use only as secondary factors in conjunction with either something the user has and something the user knows.
