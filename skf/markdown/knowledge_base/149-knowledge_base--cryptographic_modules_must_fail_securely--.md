## Description:

Whenever a cryptographic module does not fail securely this the device needs to be put in
error state so it's not useable anymore.

## Solution:

We recommend using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard on testing the cryptographic module making it perform the self-tests to see if it fails securely.
