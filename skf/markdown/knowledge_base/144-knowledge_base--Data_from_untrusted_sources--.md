## Description:

Whenever data from untrusted servers is executed by your application there is a high
probability this data could be contaminated with malicious code. Such as for example
XSS from JSON files, or XXE when parsing XML files.

## Solution:

Verify the application code does not execute uploaded data obtained from untrusted sources.
You could consider sandboxing this data when showing the content on your application.

NOTE: Sandboxing however does not stop an XXE attack. So it is highly recommended to
also encode or escape all data entering your application from third party sources.
