## Description:

Security logs should never allow unauthorized/unauthenticated access because these files include
a lot of sensitive information and could assist an attacker in leveraging attacks. Whenever
these logs can be accessed and modified, attackers could also erase their presence and attack
trail they made to the application.

## Solution:

The security logs could be protected by means of (HIDS).
This is a system that monitors important operating system files to make sure the files can only
be accessed by particular users. Security log files could also be protected by the OS itself by
defining groups and users and grant only a particular set of users access to the files.
