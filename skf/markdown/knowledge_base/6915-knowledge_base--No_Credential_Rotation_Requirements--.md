## Description:

	Do not require that memorized secrets be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically)
	unless there is a user request or evidence of authenticator compromise. 
	Password expiration policies do more harm than good, because these policies drive users to very
	predictable passwords composed of sequential words and numbers which are closely related to each
	other (that is, the next password can be predicted based on the previous password). Password change
	offers no containment benefits cyber criminals almost always use credentials as soon as they
	compromise them.
	Mandated password changes are a long-standing security practice, but current research strongly
	indicates that password expiration has a negative effect. 

## Solution:
	
	Verify that there are no arbitrary or periodic credential rotation requirements.
