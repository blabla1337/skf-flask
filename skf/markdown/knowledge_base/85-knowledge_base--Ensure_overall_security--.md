## Description:

Some parts of the application at first sight might seem to acquire a higher level of
security than i.e unauthorized/public parts of the application.
This however, is not true since breaching public parts could also lead to an attacker
compromising the application or other users accounts.

## Solution:

Always ensure full hardened security on all layers of the web application.
