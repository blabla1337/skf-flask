## Data retention policy

## Description:

For all the data gathered in an application there should be set up a data retention policy
to make sure al the dat is removed from the application when it is no longer used. This reduces
the damage done by potential attackers when they get access to the applications data due to a breach.

## Solution:

Al the sensitive information within the application must be mapped allong with the 
time-frame it is necessary to store this data on the application. For each data set there
must be determined how to effectively clear this information from the application.
