3.4 Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs) by using any of the following approaches:
* One-way hashes based on strong cryptography, (hash must be of the entire PAN)
* Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN)
* Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored)
* Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures.
