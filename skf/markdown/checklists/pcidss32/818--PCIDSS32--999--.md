8.6 Where other authentication 
mechanisms are used (for example, 
physical or logical security tokens, smart 
cards, certificates, etc.), use of these 
mechanisms must be assigned as 
follows: 

* Authentication mechanisms must be assigned to an individual account and not shared among multiple accounts. 
* Physical and/or logical controls must be in place to ensure only the intended account can use that mechanism to gain access.
