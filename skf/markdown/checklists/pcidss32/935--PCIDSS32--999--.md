12.9 Additional requirement for service 
providers only: Service providers 
acknowledge in writing to customers that they 
are responsible for the security of cardholder 
data the service provider possesses or 
otherwise stores, processes, or transmits on 
behalf of the customer, or to the extent that 
they could impact the security of the 
customer?s cardholder data environment. 

Note: The exact wording of an 
acknowledgement will depend on the 
agreement between the two parties, the details 
of the service being provided, and the 
responsibilities assigned to each party. The 
acknowledgement does not have to include the 
exact wording provided in this requirement.
