3.4.1 If disk encryption is used (rather 
than file- or column-level database 
encryption), logical access must be 
managed separately and independently of 
native operating system authentication 
and access control mechanisms (for 
example, by not using local user account 
databases or general network login 
credentials). Decryption keys must not be 
associated with user accounts.
