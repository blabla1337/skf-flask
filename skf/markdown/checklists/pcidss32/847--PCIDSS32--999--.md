* Verify the identity of any third-party persons claiming to be repair or maintenance personnel, prior to granting them access to modify or troubleshoot devices. 
* Do not install, replace, or return devices without verification. * Be aware of suspicious behavior around devices (for example, attempts by unknown persons to unplug or open devices). 
* Report suspicious behavior and indications of device tampering or substitution to appropriate personnel (for example, to a manager or security officer).
