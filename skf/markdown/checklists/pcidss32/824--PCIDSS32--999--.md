9.1.2 Implement physical and/or logical 
controls to restrict access to publicly 
accessible network jacks. 

For example, network jacks located in 
public areas and areas accessible to 
visitors could be disabled and only 
enabled when network access is 
explicitly authorized. Alternatively, 
processes could be implemented to 
ensure that visitors are escorted at all 
times in areas with active network jacks.
