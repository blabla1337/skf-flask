8.7 All access to any database 
containing cardholder data (including 
access by applications, administrators, 
and all other users) is restricted as 
follows: 

* All user access to, user queries of, and user actions on databases are through programmatic methods. 
* Only database administrators have the ability to directly access or query databases. 
* Application IDs for database applications can only be used by the applications (and not by individual users or other non-application processes).
