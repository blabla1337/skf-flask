8.13 If the architecture requires sensitive computations be performed on the client-side, these computations are isolated from the operating system by using a hardware-based SE / TEE. Alternatively, the information is protected using obfuscation. Considering current published research, the obfuscation type and parameters are sufficient to cause significant manual effort for reverse engineers seeking to comprehend the sensitive portions of the code and/or data.
