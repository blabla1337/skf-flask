Also, you have an indicator where possible reinforcements have to be\nimplemented to avoid attacks.(i.e places where your application contains executable's)\n\n Solution:\n\nVerify that all application components (either individual or groups of source files,\nlibraries, and/or executables) that are present in the application are identified.\n\nWhen you identified these components you may want to map and document them in order to\nhave a quick reference to this infrastructure when needed.\n"

When these comments still exist in a live environment,\nan attacker could use these credentials to gain access to the system.\n\n Solution:\n\nSearch your source code for comments which contains possible usercredentials.\nYou should also verify that there are no secrets and API keys are included in the\nsource code, or end up within the resulting binary.\n\nThis also applies to providing information about business logic and other critically sensitive\ninformation.
